Therefore, providing subtitles in various languages is a great method for you to increase your channel\u0026rsquo;s reach and audience.\nThere are at least 23 languages spoken by half of the world\u0026#39;s population.  \nAccording to Ethnologue, there are at least 23 languages spoken by half of the world\u0026rsquo;s population.\nBut\u0026hellip; how can one possibly know 23 different languages?\nSure, there are a lot of polyglots out there. But, how about those who only speak 1 or 2 languages? How can they translate their videos into multiple languages?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we are going to discuss today!\nMultiple Ways To Translate Your YouTube Videos Manually Translate Your YouTube Videos Of course, the most accurate way to translate your Youtube videos is by manually translating them. Doing so means that you either can speak in the target language or hire someone who can speak in the target language.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how you can manually translate your YouTube videos:\n1 - Create an SRT file First of all, you will need to create an SRT file.\nSRT is a plain-text file that contains critical information regarding subtitles, including the start and end timecodes of your text to ensure your subtitles match your audio, and the sequential number of subtitles.\nBy having an SRT, your video will have subtitles or captions.\nThere are different software out there for you to manually create an SRT file, one of them is TextEditor.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how you can manually create an SRT file with TextEditor:\n  Order your caption lines with a number beginning from 1.\n  Click enter and put your timestamp. The format of the timestamp will be \u0026lsquo;hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds\u0026rsquo;.\n  Click enter again and start writing your caption.\n  Go to Format and click on \u0026lsquo;Make Plain Text\u0026rsquo;.\nMake sure that you have set make plain text in TextEdit to make SRT file  \n  Go to File and click save.\n  In the Save As text field, type down your file name. TextEdit will automatically put the file extension to .txt so you want to change it to .srt.\nSaving your SRT file in TextEdit  \n  Uncheck the \u0026lsquo;If no extension is provided, use .txt\u0026rsquo; box and click save.\n  2 - Translate Your SRT File Now that you have your SRT file ready, it\u0026rsquo;s time to translate it.\nHere is how you can manually translate your SRT file:\n Make a copy of the original SRT file. Change the language of the text while still maintaining the same timestamp. Save your translated SRT file.  3 - Upload Your SRT File The final step is to upload your SRT file to YouTube.\nTo do this, you need to:\n  Sign in to your YouTube account and go to YouTube Studio.\n  From the left menu, select Subtitles.\n  Select the video that you would like to edit.\n  Click add language.\nHow to add video subtitles on youtube  5. 5.

Vixer adalah editor video yang bisa melakukan:\n• Memotong, mengganti kecepatan, dan mengganti ukuran video.\n• Menambahkan tulisan, filter, musik, penyulihan suara dan bingkai video.\n• Melakukan pengaturan video\nVixer Pro Seperti banyak editor video lain di luar sana, Vixer juga memiliki versi berbayar yang memungkinkan kalian untuk:\n Menggabungkan beberapa video. Akses tak terbatas ke semua musik.  • Akses tak terbatas ke semua filter.\n• Akses tak terbatas ke semua pengaturan.\n• Akses tak terbatas ke semua bingkai.\n• Akses tak terbatas ke semua pengaturan tulisan.\n• Mengekspor video 4K.\nHarga Vixer Pro Di tahun 2021, Vixer mengenakan biaya $39,99 /tahun atau $9,99/bulan. Harganya bakalan beda-beda tergantung lokasi kalian.\nDownload Vixer disini.\nApa Yang Akan Kami Ulaskan Karena kami akan membahas versi gratis dari aplikasi ini, maka kami hanya akan membahas apa yang aplikasi ini klaim bisa mereka lakukan, seperti:\nFungsi video editor Vixer di iOS  \n Memangkas, Mempercepat, dan Memotong video  • Menambahkan Teks, Filter, Musik, Penyulihan Suara, dan Bingkai\n• Pengaturan video\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go!\nMemulai Proyek Baru Menggunakan Aplikasi Vixer Waktu kalian membuka aplikasi ini, kalian bakalan bisa membuat proyek baru. Prosesnya sederhana; Kalian cuman perlu memilih video dan klik berikutnya. Kemudian, kalian bakalan diarahkan ke platform pengeditan.\nMemulai Proyek Baru Menggunakan Aplikasi Vixer  \nSayangnya, kalian nggak bisa nambahin nama ke proyek kalian.\nOh iya, kalian cuman bisa ngegabungin 2 video atau lebih di versi berbayar. Atau, dengan kata lain, versi gratis nggak ngegabungin ngedit 2 video jadi 1.\nMemangkas, Mempercepat, Dan Memotong Video Di Vixer Memangkas Videos Menurut kami, cara memangkas video lumayan simpel dengan aplikasi ini.\nKalian bukan cuman bisa memotong video kalian, tapi juga bisa membagi video kalian menjadi beberapa bagian.\nDengan begini, video kalian yang udah dipotong bisa dibagi-bagi ke berbagai posisi di timeline proyek.\nMemangkas dan membagikan video kalian di editor video Vixer  \nSaat mencoba fungsi pemangkasan, kami nyadar kalau Vixer itu nggak punya tombol undo, jadi bakalan susah kalau kalian nggak sengaja buat error pas lagi ngedit video.\nMengatur Kecepatan Video Menyesuaikan kecepatan video kalian di Vixer juga mudah.\nKalian bisa menyesuaikan kecepatan setiap video satu per satu, atau memilih untuk menerapkan kecepatan ke semua video.\nMengatur kecepatan video di editor video Vixer  \nVixer memungkinkan kalian untuk menyesuaikan kecepatan hingga 12 kali kecepatan aslinya.\nMemotong Video Vixer memberikan 7 dimensi pemotongan yang berbeda, dari persegi, feed, story, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9, sampai 5:4.\nMemotong video di editor video Vixer  \nKalian juga bisa memutar atau membalikkan video kalian dan mengisi atau menyesuaikannya dengan bingkai.\nTapi, kalau kalian udah milih buat memotong video kalian, nih, semua video-video kalian yang lainnya bakalan kepotong juga.\nJadi, kalau kalian punya 10 video, ya sepuluh-sepuluhnya bakalan kepotong.\nMenambahkan Teks, Filter, Musik, Penyulihan Suara, Dan Bingkai Menambahkan Teks Ke Video Menurut kami, Vixer ini bagus banget buat nambahin teks ke video kalian.\nPas kami nyoba Splice, kami agak susah buat nambahin tulisan ke video.\nSedangkan untuk Vixer, aplikasi ini bisa mengatur ukuran tulisan dan juga jarak antar tulisan dan paragraf.\nBukan cuman itu, kalian juga dikasih 3 font gratis seperti Roboto, Amiri, and Handmade.\nMengatur font style, size dan latar di di editor video Vixer  \nKalian juga bisa nambahin background ke tulisan kalian, kayak di TikTok sama Instagram.\nSatu-satunya kekurangan Vixer yaitu kalian nggak bisa memperbesar timeline proyek kalian, jadi buat ngatur waktu kapan tulisannya muncul agak susah.\nMenambahkan Filter Ke Video Versi gratis Vixer memberikan 6 filter gratis.Kalian bisa menyesuaikan kapasitas filter dan memilih apakah kalian hanya ingin menerapkan filter ke satu video atau menerapkannya ke semua video.\nPilih dari 6 filter di editor video Vixer  \nTentu saja, berlangganan Vixer Pro memungkinkan kalian untuk mengakses lebih banyak filter.\nMenambahkan Musik Ke Video Vixer memiliki perpustakaan musik dengan banyak lagu yang bisa dipilih. Tapi, sama seperti kebanyakan editor video\u0026hellip; fungsi ini cuman untuk pengguna Pro.\nMenambahkan musik di editor video Vixer  \nTAPI, kalian bisa milih buat nambahin musik kalian sendiri atau dari iTunes. Kalau kalian nambahin lagu dari iTunes, ya yang pastinya kalian harus beli dulu lagunya.\nJKalau kalian nambahin musik kalian sendiri, kalian bisa mengedit volume, memangkas durasinya, dan juga menambahkan efek seperti fade in dan fade out.\nMenambahkan Penyulihan Suara Ke Video Untuk menambahkan penyulihan suara, kalian harus menekan ikon mikrofon di bawah ikon musik. Akan ada hitungan mundur di layar dan kalian bisa mulai berbicara setelah audio direkam.\nMenambahkan penyulihan suara di editor video Vixer  \nTapi, fungsi ini ada kelemahannya\u0026hellip; Kalau kalian udah selesai merekam audio, kalian nggak bisa nambahin penyulihan suara lagi. Jadi, kalau kalian salah buat kesalahan pas nambahin suara, ya mau nggak mau harus buat lagi.\nMenambahkan Bingkai Ke Video Buat kalian yang suka ngatur dimensi video yang salah, ini berguna banget.\nUntuk platform yang berbeda, misalnya Intagram sama Facebook, dimensi video yang mereka tentuin juga berbeda. Jadi, misalnya video yang udah kita edit itu sizenya 4:3, tapi di instagram sizenya beda\nNah, dengan nambahin bingkai, kalian bisa membagikan video kalian tanpa harus ngedit lagi.\nDengan Vixer, kalian bisa milih berbagai macam bingkai. Mulai dari original, kotak, story atau feed.\nJadi, walaupun video kalian dalam format landscape, tapi masih bisa di share di Insta Story tanpa memotong sebagian video kalian.\nMenambahkan bingkai ke video di editor video Vixer  \nUntuk menyesuaikan ukuran video, kalian harus menggeser garis di layar.\nOh ya, kalian juga bisa memilih warna bingkai loh!\nMelakukan Pengaturan Video Di Vixer Iya, Vixer bisa melakukan pengaturan dibawah ini:\n exposure contrast highlights shadows saturation vibrance tint temperature fade sharpen  Tapi\u0026hellip; disini kami kecewa\u0026hellip;\nSoalnya cuman bisa digunakan oleh pengguna PRO\u0026hellip;\nMengekspor Hasil Editan Kalian Dari Vixer Vixer memungkinkan kalian untuk menyimpan video menjadi 4 kualitas berbeda: Ultra HD - 4K (hanya untuk pengguna PRO), Full HD - 1080p, HD - 720p, and Large - 540p.\nMenyimpan video kalian ke berbagai kualitas di editor video Vixer  \nKalau kalian nggak pengen ekspor ke perpustakaan galeri, kalian juga bisa langsung membagikan video ke Instagram Story, Feed, iMessage, dan E-mail.\nHal Positif Dari Menggunakan Vixer Hal Positif Dari Menggunakan Editor Video Vixer  \n Pengalaman memotong dan mengiris video yang mulus. Kalian bisa menyesuaikan hingga 12 kali kecepatan video. Bagus banget buat menambahkan teks ke video. Fitur bingkai bakalan ngebantu banget pas kalian mau mengunggah video ke berbagai platform yang membutuhkan dimensi berbeda. Video bisa disimpan ke dalam kualitas video yang berbeda. Kalian bisa langsung membagikan video ke berbagai platform.  Hal Minus Dari Menggunakan Vixer Hal Minus Dari Menggunakan Vixer  \n Kalian nggak bisa menambahkan nama ke proyek. Hanya bisa mengedit 1 video dalam versi gratis. Nggak ada tombol undo. Kalau satu video di potong, semuanya bakalan ikut kepotong. Kalian nggak bisa memperluas atau meminimalkan timeline proyek. Setelah penyulihan suara direkam, kalian nggak bisa rekam suara yang lain. Sebagian besar fitur nggak tersedia untuk versi gratis.  Kesimpulan Secara garis besar, kami memberikan VIxer (versi gratis) 2 dari 5 bintang.\n2 bintang tersebut kami berikan dari 2 hal terhebat dari aplikasi Vixer, yaitu dalam menambahkan tulisan dan bingkai.\nKami merasa agak sedih soalnya nggak bisa gabungin 2 video atau lebih di versi gratis. Tapi, kalau kalian cuman mau ngedit 1 video, Vixer itu oke banget.\nSekarang setelah kalian baca sampai sejauh ini, kalian pernah nggak mikirin cara untuk meningkatkan jumlah penonton video kalian?\nBeberapa cara untuk meningkatkan penonton video adalah dengan menambahkan transkripsi atau subtitel video, menerjemahkan video, atau menambahkan penyulihan suara dalam bahasa lain.\nVideoTranslator dapat melakukan hal-hal ini untuk membantu meringankan 3 proses ini.\nMisalnya, untuk melakukan transkripsi menggunakan VideoTranslator, berikut adalah hal-hal yang perlu kalian lakukan:\nTambahkan transkripsi video dengan menggunakan VideoTranslator.ai  \n Log in ke akun Video Translator kalian. Upload video kalian menggunakan tombol quicktranscribe. Pilih bahasa dan dialek dari video kalian dan klik tombol accept untuk memulai proses transkripsi. Begitu proses transkripsi selesai, cek hasil transkripsi dan benarkan tata bahasa seperti kapitalisasi dan tanda baca titik. Kalian bisa memilih untuk menanam subtitle di video atau mengunduh file SRT secara terpisah.  Simpel banget, kan?\nYuk, coba VideoTranslator gratis disini.\nSemoga kalian suka review kami tentang Vixer!\nSampai jumpa di artikel mereview aplikasi editor video berikutnya!\nUntuk informasi lebih lanjut tentang Video Translator, jangan segan-segan untuk menghubungi kami di hello@videotranslator.ai .\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/review-aplikasi-vixer-untuk-mengedit-video-di-iphone/","tags":["Indonesian"],"title":"Review Aplikasi Vixer Untuk Mengedit Video Di Iphone"},{"categories":["Translation","Transcription","Video translator","Video translation","Video transcription","Video dubbing","Subtitles","Enterprise"],"contents":"Hello, fam!\nLast month, we made a review about Splice video editor.\nThe app was, in fact, really good and we rated it a 4 out of 5.\nWe are still in search of another phone video editor and this time we are going to make a review about Vixer Video Editor!\nWhat Is Vixer Video Editor? Vixer is a video editor that allows you to:\n• Trim, Speed, Crop videos\n• Add Text, Filters, Music, Voice Over, Frames\n• Adjust video settings\nVixer Pro Like many other video editors out there, VIxer also has the paid version which allows you to:\n Merge multiple videos.  • Unlimited access to all music.\n• Unlimited access to all filters.\n• Unlimited access to all adjusts.\n• Unlimited access to all frames.\n• Unlimited access to all fonts.\n• Export 4K videos.\nVixer pro Pricing As of 2021, Vixer charges $39.99 Yearly or $9.99 Monthly. The price may also vary depending on your location.\nDownload Vixer here.\nWhat We Will Be Judging Since we are going to make a review of the free version of the app, this article will talk about how good Vixer is at the things it claims it can do:\nVixer Video Editor Functions in iOS  \n Trimming, Speeding, and Cropping videos  • Adding Text, Filters, Music, Voice Over, and Frames\n• Adjusting video settings\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go!\nStarting A New Project Vixer App When you open the application, you will be able to create a new project. The process is simple; you just have to pick your video and click next. Then, you will be redirected to the editing platform.\nProject name cannot be added in Vixer  \nUnfortunately, you can\u0026rsquo;t add a name to your project.\nAlso, please note that you can only merge 2 or more videos in the paid version.\nI think the Splice app is winning big time in terms of starting a new project.\nTrimming, Speeding, And Cropping Videos On Vixer Trimming Videos We think that trimming your video is fairly simple with this app. Not only that you can trim your videos but you can also split your video. This way, you can separate your video into different parts and move them around.\nTrimming and splitting your video in Vixer video editor  \nWhile trying out the trimming option, we realised that Vixer does not provide undo button, making it hard for you if you accidentally trimmed your video too short.\nAdjusting Video Speed Adjusting your video speed on Vixer is also easy. You can individually adjust the speed of each video, or choose to apply the new speed to all videos.\nAdjust your video speed in Vixer video editor  \nVixer allows you to adjust the speed up to 12 times the original speed.\nCropping Videos Vixer gives you 7 different cropping dimensions, from square, story, feed, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9, to 5:4.\nCrop your videos in Vixer video editor  \nYou can also rotate or flip your video and fill or fit it to the frame.\nHowever, there is no option to individually crop your footage. Once you have cropped the video, it applies to all.\nAdding Text, Filters, Music, Voice Over, and Frames Adding Text To Your Video We think Vixer is winning when it comes to adding text to your videos.\nWith Splice, we struggled quite a bit while trying to add text to our video. Vixer enabled us to do some things that Splice didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nWith Vixer, we could adjust the font size, text spacing, and paragraph spacing. Not only that, but you can also get 3 free fonts namely Roboto, Amiri, and Handmade.\nAdjust your text font, styling and background on Vixer video editor  \nOn top of that, you can also add background to your text.\nThe only downside to adding text in Vixer is that you can\u0026rsquo;t zoom in or out of your work timeline, making it harder to adjust the text timing.\nWe would say that Vixer is a really great app to add text to your videos.\nAdding Filters To Your Video The free version of Vixer allows you to get 6 filters. You can adjust the capacity of the filter and choose whether you want to only apply the filter to one video or apply it to all videos.\n6 filters to choose on Vixer video editor  \nOf course, subscribing to Vixer Pro allows you to access more filters.\nAdding Music To Your Video Vixer has a music library with plenty of songs to choose from. Just like any other video editor\u0026hellip; it is only for Pro users.\nAdding music in Vixer video editor  \nYou do, however, have the option to either choose from your own library or from iTunes (which, you have to individually purchase, just so you know).\nIf you happen to have your own music, you can add it and then edit the volume, trim the length, and also add effects such as fade in and fade out.\nAdding Voice Over To Your Video To add a voice-over, you have to press the microphone icon under the music icon. There will be a countdown on the screen and you can start talking once the audio is being recorded.\nAdding voice over to your video in Vixer video editor  \nThere is a downside, though\u0026hellip; Once you\u0026rsquo;ve recorded audio, you cannot add another voice-over. So, if you made a mistake and pressed the stop button too quickly, then you may need to redo your voice-over.\nAdding Frames To Your Video This is a holy grail for you who have the wrong video dimension.\nThere are times when your video dimension is either too big or too small for the platform that we want to share it with. We all have been there. The good thing is, Vixer can fix that problem.\nWith Vixer, you can choose video frames from original, square, story, or feed. Therefore, although your video is in the landscape format, you will still be able to publish it to Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn stories without having the videos forcefully zoomed in by those apps.\nAdd a frame to your video in Vixer video editor  \nTo adjust the video size, instead of pinching it, you have to slide through the line on your screen.\nPlus, you can also choose your frame color!\nAdjusting Your Video Settings On Vixer Yes, Vixer can allow you to adjust some video settings, such as:\n exposure contrast highlights shadows saturation vibrance tint temperature fade sharpen  But, wait\u0026hellip; this is when we got disappointed\u0026hellip;\nThey\u0026rsquo;re only for PRO users\u0026hellip;\nSaving Your Video After Editing From Vixer Vixer allows you to save your videos into 4 different qualities: Ultra HD - 4K (pro users only), Full HD - 1080p, HD - 720p, and Large - 540p.\nSaving your video in different qualities in Vixer video editor  \nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to export it to your library, you can also directly share your video to Instagram Story and Feed, iMessage, and E-mail.\nPlus Points Of Using Vixer Plus Points of Using Vixer Video Editor  \n Seamless trimming and slicing video experience. You can adjust up to 12 times your video speed. Phenomenal tool when it comes to adding text to your videos. The frame feature can help you a lot when trying to upload your videos on different platforms that require different dimensions. You can save your videos into different video qualities. You can directly share your video to different platforms.  Minus Points Of Using Vixer Minus Points of Using Vixer Video Editor  \n You can\u0026rsquo;t add a name to your project. You can\u0026rsquo;t add 2 or more videos in the free version. There is no undo button. If you want to crop your video, it will be applied to all your videos. You can\u0026rsquo;t expand or minimize the work timeline. Once a voice-over is recorded, you can record another one. Most features are not available for the free version.  Conclusion Overall, we will give Vixer (free version) a 2 out of 5 stars.\nThe 2 come from the 2 most helpful tools: adding a text and adding a frame.\nIt is quite sad to know that you can\u0026rsquo;t merge 2 or more videos in the free version. So, if you only have 1 video to edit, Vixer is the go-to app.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve made it this far, have you ever thought of ways to increase your video views?\nSome of the ways to increase your views are by adding video transcription or subtitle, translating your video, or adding an audio overlay in a different language.\nVideoTranslator can do these things to help ease these 3 processes for you.\nFor example, to transcribe a video using VideoTranslator, here\u0026rsquo;s what you have to do:\nTo transcribe audio content with Video Translator, follow the below process:\nTranscribe your video with VideoTranslator.ai  \n Log in to your Video Translator account. Upload your video using the quicktranscribe button. Select the language and dialect of the video and click the accept button to trigger the transcription. The transcription process will run in the background. Once the transcription is complete, go through and check the transcription for proper grammar e.g. capitalisation and full stops. Embed the captions into the asset, or download the srt file separately.

Terutama mereka yang memiliki gangguan pendengaran.\nSeringkali, orang-orang nggak suka nambah subtitle soalnya mereka males ngetiknya.

Menurut kami, hal ini sangat bagus agar orang-orang tau bahwa ada versi berbayar dari aplikasi ini. Artinya, akan ada beberapa fitur yang dikunci jika kalian tidak mengikuti versi berbayar dari aplikasi ini.\nKalau kalian sedang mengedit video, akan lebih baik jika kalian mengetahui sebelumnya bahwa beberapa fitur tidak akan tersedia dalam versi gratis daripada ketika kalian sudah selesai mengedit video dan baru sadar kalau video yang baru kalian edit tidak bisa disimpan karena kalian tidak menggunakan versi pro.\nMemulai Projek Baru Menggunakan Splice Sebelum kalian memulai projek baru, Splice memperbolehkan penggunanya untuk menambahkan judul projek dan memodifikasi aspek rasio dari video pengguna. Kalian bisa mengganti rasio dari video tergantung dari lokasi dimana kalian ingin membagikan video kalian.\nMemilih aspek rasio video ketika memulai projek baru menggunakan Splice  \nContohnya, kalau kalian ingin mengedit video TikTok, kalian bisa memilih rasio 9:16 mode portrait.\nUntuk kasus kami, kami hanya ingin membuat video landscape, maka kami memilih rasio 16:9 landscape.\nMengedit Video Menggunakan Splice Setelah menambahkan judul projek, media dan memilih rasio video, kami mulai proses mengedit video.\nMemangkas dan Memotong Klip Video Memangkas Video Memangkas video menggunakan Splice merupakan proses yang cukup mudah. Kalian hanya perlu memencet media kalian dan menarik ujung dari klip yang kalian pilih, kemudian geser klip tersebut untuk menyingkatkan durasi video.\nMemotong Video Berikut merupakan cara memotong video di Splice:\nMemotong video kalian menggunakan editor video Splice di iOS  \n Pencet media yang kalian inginkan Pilih lokasi dimana kalian ingin memotong media kalian Garis kuning seperti foto diatas merupakan tanda dimana media kalian akan dipotong Pencet media kalian sekali lagi Pencet split Media kalian akan dibagi menjadi 2 media yang berbeda  Menambahkan Overlay Video/Gambar Cara menambahkan overlay video atau gambar  Pastikan bahwa video/gambar yang ingin kalian tambahkan sudah berada di timeline kalian. Pencet dan tahan media yang ingin kalian tambahkan sebagai overlay. Tarik klip ke bagian dengan tulisan \u0026lsquo;drop here to turn into an overlay\u0026rsquo; Sesuaikan durasi overlay kalian seperti cara memangkas video  Menambahkan overlay di editor video Splice untuk iOS  \nHal bagus dari Splice adalah kalian bisa mengubah ukur video atau gambar yang kalian tambahkan sebagai overlay. Hal ini berarti kalian bisa menambhkan logo ke video kalian menggunakan fungsi overlay.\nTips: kalian bisa mengubah ukuran video/gambar ketika ditambahkan sebagai overlay.\nMenambahkan Filter, Efek dan Mask Pada Video Menambahkan Filter Untuk menambahkan filter, kalian harus :\n Pencet media kalian Klik ikon filter di daerah bawah di timeline Pilih filter yang kalian inginkan Atur level filter yang kalian pilih  Tips: Kalau kalian mengklik ikon centang ganda di bagian bawah timeline, kalian bisa menerapkan filter ke semua media.\nMenambahkan Efek Untuk menambahkan efek ke media, kalian harus:\n  Pencet ikon efek di bawah timeline. Pastikan bahwa kalian tidak sedang memencet media kalian kalau tidak kalian tidak akan bisa melihat efek ikon.\n  Pilih efek yang ingin kalian tambahkan\n  Kalian bisa memilih bagian video mana yang akan mendapatkan efek dengan menggeser efek yang kalian tambahkan di timeline.\nMenambahkan Mask   Menambahkan mask di editor video Splice untuk iOS  \nSetelah kalian memilih efek video, kalian juga bisa menambahkan mask dengan memencet ikon mask disamping ikon efek.\nDisini, kalian bisa memilih berbagaimacam opsi mask seperti bulat, garis, cermin atau kotak. Dengan menambahkan fungsi mask, kalian bisa menambahkan efek hanya didaerah yang sudah di mask.\nMenambahkan Tulisan Untuk menambahkan tulisan, kalian harus memencet ikon title di bawah timeline.\nSplice akan memperlakukan semua tulisan sebagai judul, jadi kalian harus memastikan bahwa latar belakang teks sudah kalian hapus jika teks tersebut akan digunakan sebagai subtitle.\nSetelah itu, kalian bisa mengetuk dua kali di layar kalian dan mengetik judul/subtitle yang kalian inginkan.\nMenambahkan tulisan di editor video Splice untuk iOS  \nKalian bisa mengatur waktu tayang tulisan dengan menggeserkannya di timeline.\nKalian juga bisa mengatur ukuran tulisan dengan mencubit teksnya.\nHal minus:\n Fungsi teks muncul secara acak di timeline. Splice tidak bisa memunculkan lokasi teks secara otomatis disamping teks terakhir yang sudah ditambahkan. Oleh karena itu, kalian harus selalu mengatur durasi waktu teks. Kalian tidak bisa melihat size dari font sehingga size font kalian tidak akan sama. Tidak ada font style yang tersedia  Menambahkan Music/Audio Menambahkan Musik Di Splice Kalian bisa menambahkan music ke video kalian dengan memencet ikon musik di bawah timeline.\nKalian bisa memilih antara mengimpor musik kalian sendiri atau mencari ribuan musik dari galeri Splice. Namun, musik dari galeri Splice hanya bisa dipakai jika kalian langganan Splice Pro.\nEfek suara di editor video Splice untuk iOS  \nTips - kalian bisa menambahkan efek suara seperti tepuk tangan, suara jalan, latar suara, dll.\nMenambahkan Audio Di Splice Untuk menambahkan audio di Splice, kalian harus pertama-tama menentukan dibagian mana kalian ingin menambahkan suara. Setelah itu, kalian bisa mulai merekam suara dengan memencet ikon voice di bawah timeline. Suara kalian akan secara otomatis direkam begitu ikon voice dipencet.\nKalau kalian punya file audio dan musik, kalian bisa memencet ikon musik untuk mengganti editan dari file audio dan musik.\nKlik ikon musik untuk menggantikan antara mengedit musik atau suara di editor video Splice untuk iOS  \nHal minus - kalian tidak bisa memencet dan menahan layar untuk merekam suara.

It means that people will be well aware that there is a paid version of the app and that some features will be locked if you don\u0026rsquo;t subscribe to the pro version.\nIt is better to know up front that some features won\u0026rsquo;t be available in the free version than to have finished editing your video and finding out that you can\u0026rsquo;t save the video because you are not on the pro version.\nStarting A New Project With Splice Before you begin a new project, Splice allows you to add a project title and modify your video\u0026rsquo;s aspect ratio. This means that you can change the ratio depending on the location you want to share the video.\nChoose your video aspect ratio when starting a project on Splice  \nFor example, if you want to edit TikTok videos, you can choose the 9:16 Portrait mode.\nIn our case, we just want to make a regular landscape video.

Cari Motivasi Cari motivasi untuk belajar bahasa baru  \nMenemukan motivasi adalah tip yang paling penting buat kalian yang mau belajar bahasa baru. Yang pastinya, kalian pasti pengen pengalaman belajar kalian itu menyenangkan dan mengasyikkan, bukannya malah membosankan dan melelahkan.\nJadi, gimana caranya supaya kalian bisa menemukan motivasi?\nMotivasi itu bisa didapatkan di mana saja!\nWaktu aku masih kecil, motivasi aku untuk belajar bahasa Inggris adalah supaya aku bisa ngerti apa aja sih yang para artis bicarakan waktu diwawancarai di TV.\n\nAgak garing, ya\u0026hellip; Tapi berhasil, loh!\nMotivasi kalian bisa aja untuk terhubung kembali dengan budaya kalian, membangun koneksi baru atau menjelajahi budaya lain.\nMenemukan motivasi bakalan membantu kalian supaya tetap berkomitmen dalam perjalanan belajar bahasa baru.\n2. Menentukan Tujuan Ketika aku masih kuliah, aku diajarin tentang akronim penentuan tujuan yang SMAART.\nBuat goal yang SMAART  \nSasaran SMAART adalah singkatan dari spesifik (specific), terukur (measurable), agresif namun dapat dicapai (agressive yet achievable), relevan (relevant), dan terikat waktu (time-bound).\nKetika tujuan kalian ditetapkan dengan akronim ini, kalian bisa mencapai hasil yang lebih besar karena kalian tahu persis apa yang kalian inginkan.\nContoh tujuan SMAART bisa seperti:\n Aku pengen bisa menonton Drama Korea tanpa subtitle dalam enam bulan. Untuk mencapai tujuan ini, aku bakalan mempelajari 20 kalimat baru setiap hari.\n Dalam 6 bulan, kalian bakalan mempelajari 18.000 kata baru!\nMemiliki tujuan SMAART akan membantu kalian mencapai tujuan dengan lebih cepat.\n3. Menonton Film/Drama Asing Menonton Film/Drama Asing  \nTip ini adalah tip favorit aku.\nTentu saja, mempelajari tata bahasa dalam bahasa baru itu penting. Tapi dalam dunia nyata, penutur asli juga tidak berbicara seperti apa yang diajarkan oleh buku teks.\nBahasa buku teks itu terlalu kaku.\nJadi, apa cara terbaik untuk berbicara bahasa seperti yang dilakukan penduduk asli? Tonton acara asing.\nDengan menonton Serial TV Bahasa Inggris, aku bisa belajar bahasa-bahasa gaul.\nKalian juga lebih mudah untuk mengetahui kata-kata baru dengan menonton acara asing.\nMisalnya, ketika aku sedang menonton Drama Korea, kalimat berikut terus diulang-ulang:\n  가지마/ga-ji-ma (jangan pergi)\n가지마/ga-ji-ma (jangan pergi)  \n  보고싶어/bo-go-sip-eo (aku merindukanmu)\n보고싶어/bo-go-sip-eo (aku merindukanmu)  \n  괜찮아/gwaenchanh-a (kamu tidak apa apa?)\n괜찮아/gwaenchanh-a (kamu tidak apa apa?)  \n  미안해/mian-hae (maaf)\n미안해/mian-hae (maaf)  \n  어떻게/eo-tteoh-ge (bagaimana?)\n어떻게/eo-tteoh-ge (bagaimana?)  \n  Jadi, sekarang waktu aku ngomong sama teman-teman Koreaku, aku bakalan menggunakan kata-kata berikut!\n4. Berbicara Dengan Orang Lain Berbicara Dengan Orang Lain  \nSalah satu tantangan dalam mempelajari bahasa baru adalah tidak memiliki siapa pun untuk berlatih.\nWaktu aku masih sekolah, aku nggak bisa ngomong Bahasa Mandarin secara lancar karena aku nggak punya siapa-siapa buat berlatih.\nOrangtuaku nggak bisa ngomong Bahasa Mandarin, dan teman-teman sekelasku juga nggak jago ngomong Bahasa Mandarin.\nWaktu aku mulai kerja sampingan di Australia, teman kerjaku banyak yang dateng dari Tiongkok. Aku bahkan belajar lebih banyak kalimat-kalimat mandarin dalam durasi itu dibandingkan selama 12 tahun sekolah.\nKalau kalian nggak punya teman untuk latihan, kalian bisa coba mencari teman lewat internet, seperti Twitter, Reddit atau di game online.\nAku sendiri punya banyak kawan di Twitter dan udah ketemu lumayan banyak dari mereka di berbagai negara.\n5. Tinggalkan Zona Nyaman Waktu aku masih sekolah, aku tau beberapa orang yang besar di Indonesia tapi nggak bisa berbicara Bahasa Indonesia. Mereka sekolah di sekolah yang menggunakan Bahasa Inggris sebagai metode belajar, tinggal di lingkungan ynag penuh dengan orang asing dan hanya berkawan dengan orang asing. Mereka nggak punya alasan untuk belajar Bahasa Indonesia.\nTinggalkan Zona Nyaman  \nKalau kalian emang pengen belajar bahasa yang baru, kalian harus tinggalin zona nyaman kalian dan berkawan dengan orang-orang baru, terutama orang yang bisa berbicara bahasa yang ingin kalian kuasai.\nAspek yang lain selain dari meninggalkan zona nyaman adalah untuk percaya diri dalam berkomunikasi dalam bahasa asing.\nAku dulu susah banget buat belajar Bahasa Mandarin soalnya aku minder. Bahasa Mandarin memiliki banyak intonasi dan intonasi yang berbeda memiliki arti yang beda juga.\nAku dulu sering diejek kalau cara bacanya salah, jadinya aku nggak percaya diri lagi.\nWaktu aku udah kerja sambilan, kawan kerjaku dari Tiongkok nggak pernah ngetawain cara aku ngomong dalam Bahasa Mandarin. Bahkan, mereka malah ngajarin aku untuk ngomong dengan cara yang benar. Hal ini lah yang beneran ngebantu aku buat percaya diri dalam berkomunikasi di Bahasa Mandarin.\nNinggalin zona nyaman kalian itu emang menakutkan, tapi 100% worth it!\n6. Mendengarkan Podcast Mendengarkan Podcast  \nKalau kalian nggak punya waktu untuk nonton film, serial tv atau video, kalian harus banget dengerin podcast. Sekarang ini banyak banget program bahasa yang tersedia dalam bentuk podcast di Spotify atau Apple Podcast.\nKalian bisa download programnya atau streaming waktu kalian on the way kerja.\nDengan dengerin podcast, kalian bisa jadi lebih terbiasa dengan kata-kata bahasa asing.\nKalian juga bisa cepetin kecepatan podcastnya kalau menurut kalian si pembicara berbicara terlalu pelan atau memperlambat kecepatan podcastnya kalau si pembicara berbicara terlalu cepat.\n7. Buat Flash Cards Buat kalian yang belum tau apa itu flashcard, flashcard adalah metode belajar dengan menggunakan kartu-kartu yang biasanya bergambar.\nBelajar menggunakan flash cards  \nKetika kalian belajar bahasa yang baru dengan membaca buku, kalian bisa merasa kewalahan dengan jumlah kata yang kalian lihat.\nFlashcards bakalan membantu kalian untuk belajar dengan mudah.\n \u0026ldquo;Flash card memberi otak Anda cara yang sangat cepat untuk memeriksa apakah Anda menjawab dengan benar. Mereka juga membantu Anda terlibat dalam ingatan aktif, yang mengajarkan otak Anda untuk mengingat suatu istilah, konsep atau proses tanpa petunjuk konteks. Mereka memungkinkan Anda untuk mengulangi tindakan tersebut. belajar dan menghafal sampai Anda menjadi ahli informasi, \u0026ldquo;kata Direktur Pemasaran Peterson\u0026rsquo;s, Elizabeth Barry.\n 8. Menulis Menurut para ahli, menulis membantu kalian dalam meningkatkan kemampuan mengingat sesuatu.\nLatihan menulis dalam bahasa asing  \nOleh karena itu, kalian harus berlatih menulis dalam bahasa target kalian.\nNggak harus berupa esai, kalian cukup menulis ulang teks, puisi, atau cerita pendek.\nInti dari latihan menulis adalah untuk membantu kalian membiasakan diri dengan kata-kata dan membantu kalian mengingat hal-hal yang sudah kalian pelajari.\n9. Membaca Membaca untuk belajar bahasa asing  \nMembaca teks dalam bahasa yang ingin kalian pelajari bakalan membantu kalian untuk melatih pengucapan kata.\nCobalah membaca buku dengan suara keras.\nKalian bisa berhenti waktu kalian ketemu kata yang asing, kemudian kalian tulis kata tersebut, terjemahkan dan lanjut membaca.\nKalau kalian terus menerus menggulang proses ini, kalian pasti bisa menguasai bahasa baru!\n10. Latihan Setiap Hari Memiliki rutinitas akan membantu kalian dalam menghilangkan gangguan karena kalian hanya fokus pada hal-hal yang penting.\nkalau kalian pengen belajar bahasa baru, jangan cuman latihan dua hari sekali. Kemungkinan besar kalian bakalan lupa apa yang sudah kalian pelajari atau kehilangan motivasi.\nBuat jadwal harian yang dapat mengakomodasi tujuan SMAART kalian.\nMembuat jadwal belajar bahasa asing  \nLatihan bisa dilakukan dalam berbagai bentuk, seperti yang sudah aku katakan di tip sebelumnya. Berikut ini contohnya \u0026hellip;\nKalau kalian mau belajar bahasa Spanyol, kalian bisa melakukan ini:\nSenin: menonton film Spanyol setelah bekerja atau sekolah\nSelasa: Lakukan panggilan zoom dengan teman online Spanyol kalian\nRabu: Habiskan malam kalian dengan orang-orang dari komunitas Spanyol\nKamis: Dengarkan podcast bahasa Spanyol dalam perjalanan ke kantor\nJumat: Membaca artikel berita Spanyol di pagi hari\nSabtu: Tulis puisi Spanyol sebelum melakukan tugas Anda\nMinggu: Bacalah buku bahasa Spanyol sebelum tidur\nBerlatih setiap hari tidak harus membosankan. Kalian bisa melakukan berbagai hal selama kalian melakukannya secara teratur.\nNah, sekarang kalian udah siap untuk menguasai bahasa baru.

Kali ini, kita bakalan ngebahas tentang terjemahan video.\nKebanyakan dari kalian pasti udah akrab dengan istilah penerjemah tulisan, misalnya penerjemah buku. Tapi, kebanyakan dari kalian mungkin belum tau tentang istilah penerjemah video. Jadi, apa sih penerjemah video itu?\n Terjemahan Video adalah proses menerjemahkan konten video, umumnya dalam bahasa Inggris, ke bahasa lain.\n Proses ini bisa melibatkan hal-hal berikut:\nProses menerjemahkan video  \n Transkripsi Video Terjemahan Video Video Dubbing (opsional)  Proses Dalam Menerjemahkan Video 1. Transkripsi Video Transkripsi video  \n Transkripsi video adalah proses mengubah suara (lisan) menjadi teks (tulisan).\n Ada dua cara untuk mengubah bentuk lisan menjadi tulisan:\n  Memanfaatkan teknologi kecerdasan buatan\nSalah satu cara yang paling gampang untuk mengubah bentuk lisan menjadi tulisan adalah dengan menggunakan teknologi kecerdasan buatan. Teknologi ini bisa mengubah bentuk lisan menjadi tulisan secara otomatis sehingga mempermudah proses transkripsi, tapi kekurangannya hasil yang dihasilkan nggak akurat. Oleh karena itu, teknologi ini masih membutuhkan campur tangan manusia untuk memastikan bahwa tulisan yang dihasilkan sudah akurat.\n  Menulis transkripsi secara manual\nCara ini merupakan cara yang paling akurat dalam mengubah bentuk lisan menjadi tulisan, tapi memakan banyak waktu dan energi. Cara ini mengandalkan manusia untuk melakukan proses transkripsi. Hasil akhir dari metode ini akan sangat akurat.\n  Manfaat Dari Transkripsi Video: Transkripsi video punya beragam manfaat, teman-teman. Salah satunya adalah agar bisa dicari oleh mesin pencari (search engine).\nMesin pencari seperti Google, Yahoo atau Bing nggak bisa memahami konten audio atau video karena mereka mengandalkan tulisan untuk berfungsi.\nJadi, gimana dong caranya supaya konten kalian bisa dicari oleh mesin pencari? Ya, kalian harus menggunakan transkripsi video. Setelah konten video memiliki transkripsi, mesin pencari baru bisa menampilkan konten kalian.\nSelain digunakan oleh mesin pencari, transkripsi video juga digunakan untuk memberi orang-orang lebih banyak akses. Menambahkan transkrip bakalan membuat perbedaan yang besar untuk orang-orang yang:\nMembaca menggunakan media digital  \n Punya gangguan pendenggaran Lagi di ruangan berisik Lagi di ruangan dimana suara tidak boleh terdengar, misalnya seorang ibu yang nggak pengen ngebangunin anaknya.  Yang terakhir, transkripsi video digunakan untuk memulai proses menerjemah video. Tanpa transkripsi, video kalian nggak bisa diterjemahkan oleh orang lain yang nggak ngerti bahasa kalian. Video tersebut juga nggak bisa diterjemahkan secara otomatis oleh penerjemah bertenaga kecerdasan buatan.\nMenulis teks  \nVideo transkripsi itu penting banget, kan, teman-teman?!\n2. Terjemahan Video Setelah memiliki transkripsi, video tersebut sekarang bisa diterjemahkan. Sama seperti proses mengubah bentuk lisan menjadi tulisan, terjemahan video juga bisa dilakukan dengan menggunakan teknologi kecerdasan buatan atau dengan memperkerjakan penerjemah profesional. Kelebihan dan kekurangan metode-metode tersebut juga kurang lebih sama.\nContoh:\nSeandainya kalian punya akun YouTube, nih. Kalian punya video tentang cara memasak nasi goreng. Video kalian kan dalam Bahasa Indonesia, jadi gimana caranya supaya orang-orang yang nggak bisa Bahasa Indonesia bisa ngerti konten kalian? Nah, itulah fungsi terjemahan video. Jadi, kalian harus mengubah suara menjadi teks. Dalam kasus YouTube, kalian bisa mengupload subtitle. Kalau kalian memiliki subtitle, YouTube bisa secara otomatis menerjemahkan video kalian ke bahasa lain dengan menggunaka Google Translate.\nJadi, oke banget kan kalau kalian menerjemahkan video kalian?!\n3. Video Dubbing Kartun Doraemon  \nKalian pasti sering nonton kartun-kartun di RCTI atau Global TV seperti Doraemon, Ninja Hatori, Hamtaro, Crayon SinChan, Naruto dan lain-lain. Kartun-kartun tersebut merupakan salah satu contoh dari video dubbing.\n Video dubbing adalah proses menggantikan suara asli ke bahasa lain.\n Sama seperti proses mengubah bentuk lisan menjadi tulisan, video dubbing juga bisa dilakukan dengan menggunakan teknologi kecerdasan buatan atau dengan memperkerjakan pengisi suara. Tentunya, suara yang dihasilkan oleh teknologi kecerdasan buatan bakalan nggak natural atau kedengaran seperti robot. Sedangkan suara yang dihasilkan oleh pengisi suara bakalan lebih natural. Tetapi, teknologi kecerdasan buatan tidak membutuhkan biaya dan waktu yang banyak.\nSeperti yang kalian tau, bahasa asli dari kartun-kartun yang kita nonton di TV kebanyakan adalah antara Bahasa Inggris atau Bahasa Jepang.\nAda beberapa alasan kenapa video dubbing banyak dipilih orang:\n Nggak semua orang gemar membaca Beberapa orang berada di lokasi yang tidak nyaman untuk membaca Banyak anak balita yang belum bisa membaca Banyak orang lansia yang kesulitan untuk membaca  Maka oleh itu, video dubbing disukai banyak orang, terutama di Indonesia.\nKenapa Transkripsi Video, Terjemahan Video dan Video Dubbing Itu Penting? Kenapa Transkripsi Video, Terjemahan Video dan Video Dubbing Itu Penting?  \n1. Eksport Pembesaran market itu penting. Salah satu cara supaya sebuah perusahaan bisa mengekspansikan bisnisnya adalah dengan melakukan 3 hal diatas.\n2. Kesehatan Ketika Virus Corona pertama kali menyerang Australia, pemerintah Australia mengeluarkan brosur-brosur tentang cara mencegah virus tersebut dalam bentuk video yang disebarluaskan diberbagai media, serperti rumah sakit, TV, internet dan tempat-tempat umum lainnya. Video-video tersebut juga diterjemahlan ke berbagai macam bahasa, salah satunya Bahasa Indonesia.\nOrang Indonesia merupakan salah satu komunitas terbesar di Australia. Banyak imigran dari Indonesia membawa orangtuanya ketika mereka pindah ke Australia. Namun, banyak dari mereka yang tidak begitu mengerti Bahasa Inggris. Oleh karena itu, terjemahan video itu penting banget. Pasien dan keluarganya bakalan ngerasa lebih tenang ketika mereka bisa mengakses informasi dalam bahasa yang mereka mengerti.\n3. Edukasi Kalian pernah nggak sih ketemu video yang penting banget buat tugas sekolah atau kuliah kalian, tapi videonya dibahasa yang kurang kalian mengerti. Aduh, pasti nyebelin banget.\nNah, dengan adanya terjemahan video, video yang pengen kalian nonton tentunya bisa diakses oleh lebih banyak orang. Jadi, bahasa bukan lagi batasan untuk belajar.\nAsik!\nKerjasama Dengan Perusahaan Penerjemah Video Itu Seperti Apa? Nah, kan kalian sekarang udah tau penerjemah video itu seperti apa. Terus, kerjasama dengan perusahaan penerjemah video itu kayak gimana, sih?\nContoh yang bakalan kita pakai kali ini adalah kerjasama antara Video Translator dan Dandelions. Dandelions adalah perusahaan luar angkasa dan Internet untuk Segala (Internet of Things) yang berbasis di Sydney, Australia. Video Translator dipercayakan oleh mereka untuk memproduksi konten-konten video mereka, teman-teman.\nYuk, kita cari tau apa aja yang kami lakuin buat Dandelions!\n1. Produksi Video Produksi Video  \nKetika ada konten video yang mau disebar oleh Dandelions, tim dari Video Translator yang ngeditnya. Jadi, video mentah atau video yang belum diedit dari mereka, kami yang olah. Hasilnya tentu saja harus memiliki kualitas yang tinggi.\n2. Transkripsi Video Transkripsi Video  \nSeperti yang sudah kita bahas tadi, proses dalam menerjemah video yang pertama adalah membuat transkrip. Setelah videonya selesai diedit, kami menggunakan teknologi kecerdasan buatan untuk menyalin suara secara otomatis. Setelah hasilnya jadi, kami baru mengedit hasil salinan tersebut untuk memastikan bahwa salinannya akurat.\n3. Terjemahan Video Terjemahan Video  \nVideo yang digunakan oleh Dandelions sebagai perusahaan dari Australia tentunya merupakan Bahasa Inggris. Karena Dandelions ingin menjangkau orang-orang yang nggak bisa Bahasa Inggris, mereka mau konten mereka diterjemahkan ke berbagai macam bahasa.\n4. Video Dubbing Video Dubbing  \nBeberapa macam kultur lebih memilih buat mendengarkan pengisi suara dibandingkan buat membaca. Maka dari itu, kami juga menyediakan dubbing dalam versi teknologi kecerdasan buatan dan juga suara manuasia.\nKombinasi dari keempat elemen tersebut bakalan membuat konten yang bisa membuat dampak yang besar bagi penonton multibahasa.\nKenapa Perusahaan Luar Angkasa Butuh Terjemahan Video? Konten video dalam bahasa lain sering dipakai oleh berbagai macam perusahaan, tapi jarang banget dipakai oleh perusahaan luar angkasa. Jadi, kenapa perusahaan luar angkasa seperti Dandelions mau menerjemahkan konten video mereka?\n1. Untuk Membuat Industri Luar Angkasa Lebih Mudah Diakses Membuat Industri Luar Angkasa Lebih Mudah Diakses  \nSelama ini, perusahaan luar angkasa selalu punya konotasi sebagai perusahaan milik negara, seperti NASA atau perusahaan milik pengusaha dengan penhasilan trilliunan seperti Tesla. Baru akhir-akhir ini pemerintah dan berbagai macam perusahaan lain mau membuat perusahan luar angkasa supaya bisa lebih muda dijangkau.\nNah, dengan menerjemahkan konten-konten ke dalam berbagai bahasa, harapannya adalah untuk membuka pintu industri luar angkasa bagi orang lain di seluruh dunia.\n2. E-learning E-Learning  \nUntuk membuat industri luar angkasa lebih mudah diakses, Dandelion mau menyediakan video pendidikan untuk penonton mereka. Banyak penelitian yang menunjukkan kalau orang-orang biasanya bisa belajar lebih muda kalau bahasa yang digunakan adalah bahasa sehari-hari mereka.\nPandemi COVID-19 memaksakan orang-orang untuk belajar lewat internet, oleh karena itu permintaan untuk e-learning terus meningkat. Nah, karena semua orang sekarang belajarnya lewat internet, maka Dandelions juga mau mengakomodasikan video pendidikan dalam berbagai bahasa.\n3. Komunikasi Antar Perusahaan Komunikasi Antar Perusahaan  \nAustralia merupakan negara yang sangat multikultural. Hal ini berarti bahwa Dandelions bakalan punya pekerja-pekerja dari mancanegara.\nOleh karena itu, Dandelions ingin meminimalisirkan kesalahpahaman karena bahasa. Konten video yang diterjemahkan bakalan membuat komunikasi yang lebih efektif dan hubungan yang lebih kuat antara tim multikultural.\n4. Kampanye Pemasaran Multibahasa Kampanye Pemasaran Multibahasa  \nKetika kalian membuat konten pemasaran (marketing content), kalian pastinya pengen dong supaya kampanye kalian bisa dicari orang.\nGimana caranya supaya kalian bisa menggunakan konten yang sama buat target yang berbeda?\nCaranya adalah dengan menerjemahkan konten pemasaran kalian. Kampanye pemasaran yang diterjemahkan akan memungkinkan Dandelions untuk menciptakan interaksi dan koneksi otentik dengan penonton mereka.\nYay!

What is it, how to use it, where it may be useful, and what do agreements involving video translation look like?\nWhat Is Video Translation? Video Translation is the process of translating video content, generally in English, to a different language. It can involve the below steps:\n Video Transcription Video Translation Video Dubbing (optional)  \nTo learn how video translation actually works, please look at this article.\nHow To Use Video Translation? There are a number of different ways to use video translation. Some of the general benefits are:\n\n  Video SEO\nSearch engines do not understand an audio or video content as they are primarily text-based. To make your audio or video content indexable by search engines is the primary reason to use Speech-To-Text Transcription AI\u0026rsquo;s.\n  Accessibility\nFor people who have vision or hearing disabilities, adding the transcript makes all the difference!\n  Scale\nHow will someone who does not speak, read or think in English buy your product? Adding in the transcriptions in different languages means that they can now buy your product or service!\n  Those are the basic reasons, but depending on your market, your budget, and your objectives a lot can change.\nWhere Video Transcription, Translation or Dubbing may be important? Simply put, there are a few use cases:\n  Exporters\nIn a world where clients are reluctant to spend money, you need to find new clients. Using video to reach these clients is a good strategy. Read a case study involving a high tech exporter!\n  Healthcare\nReducing the load of your healthcare professionals with video translation  \nHow do you reduce the load on your healthcare professionals? You give patients and their families access to information in a language they understand.\n  Education\nVideo translation to accomodate people with ESL backgrounds  \nWorking with children is hard, but when the parent has a different background - in Australia, we call these people with these backgrounds ESL (English as a Second Language) - this can be even more challenging. Read about how you can educate adults in this case study!\n  Obviously, there are many other use cases. But these are the big use cases we see.\nWhat Does A Video Translation Partnership Look Like?

We provide Dandelions with both human and AI dubbing as a solution.\n  The combination of all 4 elements will create impactful content for multilingual audiences.\nWhy Does A Space Company Need Video Translation? Video translation is common in many industries, but not in the space industry. So, why did a space company like Dandelions choose to get their videos translated?\n  To Make The Space Industry More Accessible\nMake the space industry more accessible  \nFor the longest time, the space industry has been the exclusive domain of governments and gazillionaire entrepreneurs.

Receiving your questions mean that you are interested in the services we are offering.\nNot long ago, we received an enquiry from a customer.\nHow do you know which dialect would work when transcribing videos  \n \u0026ldquo;Hello, there are YouTube videos in Arabic News. I would like to have them transcribed, translated and dubbed into the English language so that I can understand them. Would you all be able to do this?\u0026rdquo;\n Of course, we said yes! That is precisely why we are here.\nWe offered him a quote that ranges between 10-25 USD per minute depending on the content\u0026rsquo;s complexity and whether he wanted an AI or Human dubbing.\nThe cost is relatively higher than the .15 cents per minute along with the $10 monthly fee and .30 per minute with no monthly fee with the AI usage. The high cost is, of course, if we do it for him as a managed service.\nThere is a complex process when it comes to managed service. We need to hire professional translators, manually add the baked-in captions and adjust the voice dubbing. We want to make sure that the end result will give you the best value.\nVideo Translator\u0026#39;s managed services  \nYou can find an example of how we did a managed service here.\nIn the end, Marcus decided to do it by himself because he wanted to have the videos translated regularly.

For example, it would be relatively easier to distinguish between British and American English because almost everyone is familiar with it.\n  Find the source of the video.\nFinding video source  \nFor example, if your video is from YouTube, you can find out where the person is from. If the person is, let\u0026rsquo;s say, from Mexico, then the dialect the person is speaking is most probably Mexican Spanish.\n  If you do not know a native speaker, do not speak the language and cannot find the video source, the only alternative is to pick any of the available language dialects. Most of the time, there won\u0026rsquo;t be much difference between different dialects.\nThere are probably some vocabulary differences. For example, Americans would say college. Meanwhile, the British would call it university.\nFor now, knowing which dialect a person is speaking is still a very complex thing for Artificial Intelligence to do. Of course, with the rapid development in technology, AI will soon be able to automatically determine a language\u0026rsquo;s dialect.\nConclusion There are three ways in which you can find out which dialect a person is speaking in the video you want to translate:\n Know or hire a native speaker Have a basic understanding of the target language Find the video source  Your feedback matters!  \nWe are also glad to have these kinds of questions.

Maybe multilingual?), you should definitely read this article!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s begin!\nHere are 10 tips for you if you want to learn a new language:\n1. Find your motivation Find your motivation  \nFinding your motivation is the most fundamental tip to learn a new language. You want your learning experience to be fun and exciting, not dull and exhausting.\nSo, how do you find your motivation?\nYou can find it everywhere!\nWhen I was a kid, my motivation to learn English was to understand what the celebrities said when they were interviewed on TV.\nCelebrity  \nIt is corny, I know, but it worked!\nYour motivation can be to reconnect to your culture, build new connections or explore other cultures.\nFinding your motivation will help you stay committed to your journey of learning a new language.\n2. Set a goal When I was studying for my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree, I discovered this cool goal-setting acronym called SMAART.\nThe SMAART goal stands for Specific, Measurable, Aggressive yet Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.\nSMART goal  \nWhen goals are set with this acronym, greater outcomes can be reached since you know exactly what you want.\nAn example of a SMAART goal could be:\n I want to be able to watch Korean Drama without subtitles in six months. To reach this goal, I am going to learn 20 new phrases every day.\n In 6 months, you would have learnt 18,000 new phrases!\nHaving a SMAART goal will help you achieve your goal quicker.\n3. Watch foreign shows Watching foreign shows  \nThis tip is my favourite.\nSure, learning your target language\u0026rsquo;s grammar is important. However, the native speakers don\u0026rsquo;t speak as to how the textbooks teach you.\nThe textbook language is way too formal.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s the best way to speak a language the way the natives do? Watch foreign shows.\nBy watching English TV Series, I was able to learn new slangs. I learn slangs such as \u0026ldquo;ditch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;chill\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;slay\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;stan\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;spill the tea\u0026rdquo; by watching TV.\nIt is also easier to pick up new phrases by watching foreign shows.\nFor example, when I was watching a Korean Drama, these phrases are constantly repeated:\n  가지마/ga-ji-ma (don’t go)\nK-drama: don\u0026#39;t go  \n  보고싶어/bo-go-sip-eo (I miss you)\nK-drama: i miss you  \n  괜찮아/gwaenchanh-a (Ok or are you ok?)\nK-drama: are you ok?  \n  미안해/mian-hae (I\u0026rsquo;m sorry)\nK-drama: i\u0026#39;m sorry  \n  어떻게/eo-tteoh-ge (how?)\nK-drama: how  \n  So, now when I\u0026rsquo;m talking with my Korean friends, I will randomly insert those phrases in my sentence!\n4. Converse with others Converse with others  \nOne of the challenges of learning a new language is not having anyone to practise with.\nI could not master Mandarin when I was still in school because I had no one to practise with.\nMy parents do not speak Mandarin, and my classmates were just as terrible as I did.\nWhen I started my part-time job, I had many Chinese friends. I learnt so much more new Mandarin phrases than I did for my 12-year Mandarin lessons back in school.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t find anyone to converse with, you can always find someone who is willing to on the internet. You can do it from Twitter, Reddit or even by playing online games!\nI made so many good friends on Twitter, and I have met most of them in different countries!\n5. Leave your comfort zone leave your comfort zone  \nI know some people from school who have lived most of their lives in Indonesia but cannot converse in Bahasa Indonesia. They went to a school with English as a medium, lived in a neighbourhood full of expatriates and made friends with foreigners. They did not have a reason to learn Bahasa Indonesia.\nIf you really want to learn a new language, you need to leave your bubble and expand your network. Go make friends with people who speak your target language.\nAnother important aspect of leaving your comfort zone is to be confident in speaking your target language.\nI struggled a lot to learn Mandarin because I was afraid of pronouncing the words wrong. Mandarin has different tones, and different tones have different meanings.\nI was always made fun of when I pronounced the wrong words. It crushed my confidence.\nWhen I conversed with my colleague during my part-time job, they never made fun of my \u0026lsquo;broken Mandarin\u0026rsquo;. They helped me pronounce the words correctly and boosted my confidence.\nLeaving your comfort zone will be scary, but trust me, it is worth it!\n6. Listen to podcasts listen to podcasts  \nIf you do not have time to watch movies, tv-series, or videos, you can always listen to podcasts. Nowadays, there are many language programs on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.\nYou can download the podcasts or stream them on the way to work.\nListening to podcasts will help you familiarize yourself with the words.\nYou can also increase the audio speed if you think that the speakers are speaking too slow or decrease the speed if you feel that they are talking too fast.\n7. Make flashcards Make flashcards  \nFlashcard is an effective tool to study.\nWhen you learn a new language by reading a textbook, you can get overwhelmed by the number of words that you see.\nFlashcards allow you to learn new words without cluttering your mind.\n \u0026ldquo;Flashcards give your brain a very quick way to check if you got the answer correct. They also help you engage in active recall, which teaches your brain to remember a term, concept or process without context clues. They allow you to repeat the act of learning and memorizing until you are an expert on the information,\u0026rdquo; said the Marketing Director of Peterson\u0026rsquo;s, Elizabeth Barry.\n 8. Write Writing  \nAccording to experts, writing by hand appears to improve our ability to remember things.\nFor this reason, you should definitely practise writing in your target language.\nIt does not have to be an essay. You can simply rewrite a text, poem, or short story.\nThe whole point of practise writing is to help you familiarize yourself with the words and help you remember the things.\n9. Read Reading  \nReading a text in your target language will help you practise your pronunciation.\nTry reading a book aloud.\nYou can stop when you find an unfamiliar word, write it down, find the meaning and resume.\nIf you keep on doing it, you will definitely be able to master your target language!\n10. Practise every day \nYes, you heard me right.\nPractise every day!!!\nDaily habits easily eliminate distractions because you are focused only on those things that need to be done.\nIf you want to learn a new language, don\u0026rsquo;t just do it every other day. You will most likely forget what you have learnt or lose your motivation.\nMake a daily schedule that can accommodate your SMAART goal.\nPractising can come in different forms, as I have said in the previous tips. Here is an example\u0026hellip;\nIf you want to learn Spanish, you can do this:\nMonday: watch a Spanish movie after work or school\nTuesday: Have a zoom call with your online Spanish friend\nWednesday: Spend your evening with people from the Spanish community\nThursday: Listen to Spanish podcasts on the way to work\nFriday: Read a Spanish news article in the morning\nSaturday: Write Spanish poems before doing your chores\nSunday: Read a Spanish book before going to bed\nPractising every day does not have to be dull and boring. You can do different things as long as you keep on doing it regularly.\nNow that you are ready to master a new language, why don\u0026rsquo;t you try our tool that can help you translate video contents quickly and efficiently?\nHere at Video Translator, we use Artificial Intelligence to translate your videos conveniently.\nFind out why you should use AI-powered translators here or contact us at hello@videotranslator.ai for more information.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/10-tips-to-learn-a-new-language/","tags":["English"],"title":"10 Tips That Actually Work If You Want To Learn A New Language"},{"categories":["Users","Video translation","Translation","Languages","Dialects","Artificial Intelligence"],"contents":"I was born in Indonesia, a country with over 250 million population scattered across its 17,000 islands. When I came to Australia four years ago, I noticed that most Australians with Indonesian background or mixed raced Indonesians do not know how to speak Indonesian.\nIndonesia, the land with 17,000 islands  \nSo, I began to question myself: how important it is to learn a foreign language? I came up with few answers…\nLearning a foreign language allows you to build connections If you didn’t know, Indonesia is a country with over 300 native languages. Growing up here, you would think that my mother tongue would be Bahasa Indonesia. However, my first language is a dialect from the South Sumatera province called Palembang.\nAmpera Bridge in Palembang, South Sumatera, Indonesia  \n According to Asian Languages and Literature from the University of Washington, “While Bahasa Indonesia is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7% of the total population, it is the national language and is used by 200 million people as their second language.”\n If my mother tongue were not my local dialect, I would have struggled to communicate with my relatives. The locals take pride in speaking their local dialects.\nFun fact, if you travel to Indonesia, you will most probably get a discount if you can speak in their local dialect.\nAlthough our local dialect is our mother tongue, most Indonesians can speak Bahasa Indonesia as it is our official language.\nBahasa Indonesia is commonly used for business and administrative purposes as well as by education institutions and mass media throughout the country to facilitate communication among the Indonesians.\nMy mind began to wander to the times when my family would travel to different provinces. We would visit some local shops to buy some souvenirs. Although the staffs would generally speak in a local dialect, they would immediately switch to Bahasa Indonesia when they talk to customers.\nAn Indonesian lady holding local street food  \nIf I hadn’t been able to speak Bahasa Indonesia, I would be stuck in my tiny little bubble in South Sumatera and struggle to communicate with everyone else across the country.\nLearning a foreign language will help you see the world When I was in primary school, my parents sent me to study in a school that uses English as the medium of instruction. I struggled a lot in the beginning as none of my parents speaks English.\nLittle girl going to school  \nAs a kid, I was timid to speak English in front of anyone. I thought my English was terrible, and I didn’t know enough vocabularies to express how I feel.\nI think it took me about six years to finally have the confidence in speaking English.\nIt was not until I was in middle school that I realized how blessed I am to understand English. That day, I wanted to share an online article with my parents. Since they do not speak English, I needed to find the translated version. However, I couldn’t find any!\nSearching the internet  \nThere is limited information that you can have when you do not know how to speak a foreign language. By learning English, I was able to gain so much more information about everything I want to know.\nLearning a foreign language deepen your connection to other cultures If there were one language that I regret not learning, it would be Mandarin. As an Indonesian with a Chinese background, my parents wanted me to know Mandarin. Their generation lost touch with their mother tongue because its use was banned in the country.\nChinese lantern  \nAs a young kid, I hated learning Mandarin. I would be sent to after-school Mandarin class and hated every bit of it. I was not good at it. I felt embarrassed when I speak the language because my friends would laugh at me.\nTruth be told, I was proud to say to people that I was terrible in Mandarin. I boasted of my inability to speak a foreign language.\nLooking back, I feel so silly. I wish I hadn’t done what I did.\nWhen I moved to Australia, I had a part-time job in a café where I worked with many Chinese people. That’s the moment that I realized that I should have taken my Mandarin classes seriously.\nAs a 21-year-old third-generation Chinese Indonesian, I know nothing about my history. I did not know even know the name of my great grandparents. Even if I did, I won’t be able to read their names because they would be written in Mandarin. This also means that I won’t be able to look for their names in the Chinese registry database.\nChinese calligraphy  \nSure, learning a foreign language gives you various advantages in life. However, you cannot possibly know all 7,000 languages.\nSo, what is the solution?\nArtificial Intelligence Translator Yes, you heard me right. Artificial Intelligence Translator.\nTo translate an English article into Indonesian, I would need to think about how I can translate the article sentence by sentence.

He does not just want to leave possessions; he wants to pass on his history.\nFor many Americans, most of their ancestors came from Europe in the great emigration wave before the First World War. Jeff Dormish’s ancestors also came from Europe, Slovenia, to be exact.\nSlovenia  \nIn 2016, he began on a journey to discover his past.\nAlong with 49 other Americans, Jeff participated in an international genealogy conference organized by the Slovenian Genealogy Society.\nSlovenian Genealogy Society International, Inc.  \nOn this trip, he directly saw and experienced the place where his ancestors had once resided. At that moment, the things that he had seen in pictures have come to life. Lucky for Jeff, the life-changing trip that he had undertaken was covered by a Slovenian TV station.\n5 years later, Jeff has become the President of the Slovenian Genealogy Society International based in Cleveland, Ohio. He wanted to put the 12-minute video from the Slovenian TV coverage in the archive of the genealogy group, hoping that it could help and inspire others in a similar situation. However, it was primarily spoken in Slovenian, a language that he could neither speak nor understand.\nJeff wanted the video to be translated into English. That is when he contacted VideoTranslator. Equipped with the video and Jeff’s parent’s family picture, I began to do my work.\nTranscribing The Video Before translating the video, I used VideoTranslator\u0026rsquo;s application that can automatically transcribe videos by using the AI system that is embedded in the app.\n\nTranslating The Video I understand that things can easily get lost in translation. That is why a professional translator was hired. The transcription from Video Translator\u0026rsquo;s app was transferred into a txt file and sent to a translator. The translator then came back with the translated subtitles of the video.\nCreating Burnt-In Subtitles The original video has burnt-in subtitles in Slovenian. I wanted to make sure that the new burnt-in subtitles would match the current one.\nFirst, I synced the translated subtitles to the video by using Adobe Premiere Pro. I shifted the timing a little bit to match the dialogues.\nEditing Caption Timing on Adobe Photoshop  I also added a black background behind the text with 90% transparency to make it easier for people to read and match the style of the original video.\nEditing Caption on Adobe Photoshop  After editing it, I saved the file with the burnt-in subtitles in the video.\nAfter I sent the video with the burnt-in subtitles to Jeff, he asked me to fix some name spelling errors. I realized that the spelling errors were mainly from the original video, not from the translation.\nJeff Dormish Name Typo  So, how can I fix this problem?\nI figured that I can fix this by adding a text overlay on top of the original one. I used matching font style and size and corrected the spelling errors.\nEditing Jeff Dormish\u0026#39;s Name  In the end, it looks like it was not edited at all!\nFixing Up Damaged Photo Jeff had sent us a picture of his parent’s family photo. However, the image is damaged with discolouration on the right side.\nDormish Family, Meyersdale, PA, 1928 Before Editing | Image Credit: Jeff Dormish  I know how much it would mean for him to have the picture fixed up, so I did.\nI used Adobe Photoshop to fix the image. I replaced the damaged area with pixels from the undamaged picture by using the patch tool.\nThis is the end result.\nDormish Family, Meyersdale, PA, 1928 After Editing | Image Credit: Jeff Dormish  \nWhat I Learnt Jeff’s story resonated with me. As an Indonesian of Chinese ancestry, I too often find myself wondering about my own families story.\nWhere were they from?\nWhy did they move?\nWho were the important people in their lives?\nI was born and raised in Indonesia.\nMy family does not speak mandarin, and my grandparents did not teach the Chinese dialect to me. Just like Jeff, language is a big challenge in discovering my own story.\nSeeing how far Jeff has come and what he wanted to pass along to his children has inspired me. Someday I would also like to see the places where my people had lived, how they spent their lives, who their partners and children were, and untangle the mysteries of my past.\nConclusion Helping Jeff, who wants to leave a long-lasting legacy for his family, is one reason why we do what we do.

Ceritanya dimulai dengan manusia kaleng dari Wizard of Oz yang bercita-cita untuk memiliki hati. Kemudian dilanjutkan oleh robot manusia yang menyamar sebagai Maria di Metropolis.\nKiri: Wizard of Oz | Kanan: Alan Turing Umur 16 Tahun (Image credit: Alan Turing Archive)  \nPada tahun 1950, seorang ilmuwan yang genius dari Britania Raya bernama Alan Turing menulis makalah tentang Mesin Komputasi dan Intelijen dimana dia membahas tentang pembuatan mesin cerdas dan menguji kecerdasan mereka. Buat kalian yang penasaran tentang Alan Turing, coba nonton filmnya yang berjudul The Imitation Game.\nWalaupun dongen-dongen dan ilmuwan seperti Alan Turing udah menginspirasi kelahiran dari kecerdasan buatan, konsep tentang kecerdasan buatan baru dimulai pada tahun 1956. Program kecerdasan buatan pertama dibuat berdasarkan konsep Logic Theorist oleh Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, dan Herbert Simon.\nSemenjak itu, kecerdasan buatan berkembang pesat sampai saat ini.\nKenapa Penerjemah Bertenaga Kecerdasan Buatan Itu Penting? Kecerdasan Buatan Menciptakan Pekerjaan Baru Banyak orang mikir kalau teknologi itu bakalan menghilangkan banyak pekerjaan. Forum Ekonomi Dunia memperkirakan bahwa otomasi bisa menyebabkan hilangnya 75 juta pekerjaan. Namun, mereka juga memprediksi bahwa otomasi bisa menciptakan 133 juta lapangan pekerjaan baru pada tahun 2022.\nInovasi seperti software penerjemah yang didukung oleh tenaga kecerdasan buatan tidak menghilangkan pekerjaan. Kenyataannya adalah industri seperti kami membuka lapangan pekerjaan baru. Penerjemah bertenaga kecerdasan buatan masih membutuhkan campur tangan manusia untuk memastikan bahwa perangkat lunak yang dipasang dapat berjalan dengan lancar. Selain itu, berbagai macam perbaikan baik dari sisi perangkat lunak maupun pengguna harus terus-menerus dilakukan. Penerjemah bertenaga kecerdasan buatan akan membutuhkan insinyur perangkat lunak, disainer, ahli informasi teknologi, dan banyak lagi.\nTerjemahan yang Didukung Kecerdasan Buatan Bisa Menjangkau Lebih Banyak Orang Bahasa Inggris adalah bahasa yang paling banyak digunakan di dunia. Penggunaan bahasa Inggris sangat dipengaruhi oleh kolonialisme Inggris. Inggris memperkenalkan bahasa Inggris di wilayah jajahan mereka di seluruh dunia. Hal ini membuat Bahasa Ingrris menjadi bahasa yang paling banyak digunakan di seluruh dunia dengan 1,35 miliar penutur.\nJangkau Lebih Banyak Orang Dengan Penerjemah Bertenaga Kecerdasan Buatan  \nMenariknya, dari sekian banyak penutur bahasa Inggris, hanya ada sekitar 30% dari mereka yang Bahasa ibunya adalah Bahasa Ingris. Selain Bahasa Inggris, 30% dari populasi di dunia berbicara Bahasa Mandarin, Hindi, Spanyol dan Perancis.\nJika kalian menggunakan penerjemah yang didukung kecerdasan buatan, kalian bisa menerjemahkan dokumen dan konten secara otomatis. Bayangin kalau kalian menerjemahkan dokumen dan konten kalian ke empat bahasa lain yang paling banyak digunakan, sekarang kalian bisa menjangkau jauh lebih banyak orang.\nTerjemahan Yang Didukung Kecerdasan Buatan Meningkatkan Upaya Manusia Waktu itu berharga. Kami ngerti kalau penerjemah yang didukung AI nggak bisa menggantikan penerjemah manusia. Kurangnya sentuhan manusia adalah hal yang hilang dari penerjemah yang didukung kecerdasan buatan.

It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis.\nHistory of Artificial Intelligence  \nIn the 1950s, a young British polymath called Alan Turing wrote a paper about Computing Machinery and Intelligence where he discussed building intelligent machines and testing their intelligence.\nIt wasn’t until 1956 that the concept of artificial intelligence was initialized. The first artificial intelligence program was presented based on the concept of Logic Theorist by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon.\nSince then, artificial intelligence flourished and went on a roller coaster journey of successes and setbacks.\nWhy Is AI-Powered Translator Important? AI Technology Is Creating New Jobs Many people think that technology is taking away jobs. The World Economic Forum estimated that automation may cause a loss of 75 million jobs. However, it also noted that 133 million new jobs will emerge by 2022.\nThe truth is, technological innovations such as AI-powered translation software like us do not take away jobs. In fact, we are making new pools of jobs. AI-powered translators still need human touches to ensure that the software runs smoothly. In addition, updates both from the software and user interface sides are constantly needed. AI-based companies will need software engineers, designers, IT professionals, and many more.\nAI-Powered Translation Helps You Reach A Wider Audience English is the most spoken language in the world. The widespread use of the English language is heavily influenced by British colonialism. The United Kingdom imposed English on their territories around the world, hence making it the most spoken language worldwide with 1.35 billion speakers.\nReach Wider Audience With AI-Powered Translastor  \nInterestingly, out of the billion English speakers, only about 30% of them are native speakers. About 30% of the world speak Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish and French.\nIf you use an AI-powered translator, you can automatically translate documents and contents. Imagine if you translate your documents and contents to four other most spoken languages, you can now reach 30% more of the world population.\nAI-Powered Translation Enhances Human Efforts Time is valuable. We understand that AI-powered translators cannot beat human translators. The lack of human touch is what AI-powered translators are missing. Therefore, we are here to help these professionals.\nWith AI-powered translators, we can help professional translators to automatically transcribe their documents. This process is especially beneficial in translating videos. Before the existence of AI-powered translators, professionals need to manually type down the scripts and adjust the script time to match the video. All of these tasks can now be done by AI software.\nIn short, our software enhances the speed, precision and effectiveness of human efforts\nConclusion The world is changing. AI is already changing and affecting a big part of our everyday lives. You should use an AI-powered translator because it is creating new jobs, help you reach wider markets and enhance your human efforts.\nIf you want to use AI-powered translator but do not know where to start, we are here to help you. Do not hesitate to contact us at hello@videotranslator.ai .\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/why-you-should-use-ai-powered-translator/","tags":["English"],"title":"Why You Should Use AI Powered Translator?"},{"categories":["Video translator","Video translation","Video transcription","Translation","Transcription","Subtitles","Languages","Dubbing","Case Study"],"contents":"Many of you would have heard about translation. According to Kristen Malmkjær, translation is an activity that aims to convey meaning or meanings of a given linguistic discourse from one language to another.\nWhat are the difficulties in translation? As a multilingual speaker, I have frequently asked to translate different languages. My family would ask me to translate files such as reports, articles and legal documents. However, translation also comes with its challenges.\nFirst, there are so many languages out there, and I cannot possibly learn everything. Currently, there are about 7,000 available languages around the world. Meanwhile, I only know four.\nSecond, it is easier to translate texts than videos. When there is a text available, I can retype the text and instantly translate the text. However, with a video, you need to transcribe the texts manually. It is even more challenging when you are trying to translate a video in a language that you do not speak.\nHow to easily translate your videos Video Translator wants to ease the difficulties in translating videos by offering three simple steps.\nVideo Transcription Transcribing your video  \nTranscription is the processing and transferring speech sounds into timed-text displayed on video. Video Translator uses artificial intelligence software to transcribe your videos automatically. Automatic video transcription can help you save your time by instantly converts your speech into timed text. This way, you don’t have to type the text and adjust the timing manually. Having automatic transcription is also beneficial when you are trying to transcribe speech from a language that you do not speak\nVideo Translation Translating Your Video  \nVideo translation is the process of turning your footage into a video that is suitable for multilingual audiences. As I have said before, translating a video can be challenging, especially with the massive number of available languages out there. Video Translator offers translation in over 60 languages and 150 dialects. It can easily translate texts derived from the video transcription into these languages.\nVideo Dubbing When it comes to captions, not everyone is a fan. Some people dislike reading them, while some struggle to read captions. That is why video dubbing comes in handy. Video Translator’s artificial intelligence can convert text to speech. You don’t have to be afraid of mispronouncing the texts because we can dub your video.\nCase Study By having your videos translated, you can now reach a broader range of audience. Let me give you an example. Let’s say that you are the manager of a global company. Your employees come from different countries and speak various languages. Some of your employees only know English as a second language, while some do not speak English at all. Meanwhile, you have a training video that you want to share, but it is spoken in English.\nYou can easily solve this problem by using Video Translator’s services. You can first transcribe your video. The video transcription helps your employees who know English as a second language to follow along with the speech. After that, you can translate the text into your target languages. This way, you can have one video with multiple translated subtitles. Finally, you can dub your videos. With the text to speech tool, your training video is now spoken in the language that your employees understand.\nConclusion So, in conclusion, Video Translator eases your video translation difficulties by transcribing, translating and dubbing your videos.\nSo, what are you waiting for?

Even when they go right, generally something odd happens and it all works out for the best, but things tend to not go to plan, so to speak.\nFirstly, for those of you who have recently joined our little community, welcome!\nWe are very glad to have you here, and hopefully the work of Team VideoTranslator and our community of friends, well wishers, prospects, and clients will help you achieve your goals.\nThis is a short post about what comes next.\nTurns And Roundabouts Renee moved on at the end of last year, to the far more important gig of being mum to her second child!\nWe wish her all the best! You\u0026rsquo;ll smash it for sure mate - best of luck.\nWe had a recent hire here at Team VideoTranslator, Tessa Joana, who takes the role previously held by Renee Dubé.\nTessa will be looking after our social media efforts, and also doing more besides in the video space.\nWelcome Tessa!\nWhat We Need To Fix Over the last few months, there have been numerous issues which need to be addressed in our Saas app. Putting together the feedbacks, the main issues are listed below.\nLack Of Documentation Our documentation is just not every good. So the plan is to redo a lot of the documentation.\nIn addition, we will be turning a lot of the documentation into video content. This will all get put onto our YouTube channel which is getting a bunch more content and will be better tended to going forward.\nLanguage / Dialect Mapping Issues While we have an comprehensive language dialect mapping which adds great value to our clients, we do a less than stellar job explaining this content.\nIt is also relatively hard to add/remove additional languages for a user in terms of the UX (user experience flow).\nGeneral UX Challenges Many of the workflows were developed a year or so ago, and large parts of the app are beginning to show their age.\n The material ui version needs to be patched. The core text editor experience needs to be enhanced significantly. Adding synthetic voices, that is the AI dubbing workflow, are simply terrible.  Forums We are looking at getting a forum up and running. This is where a lot of client correspondence will be put in, including where we are going with many of our projects.\nWhy?\nThe basic idea is to make a single source of truth which is searchable.\nWe have also added a search to our website, but we have not yet turned on tracking on the search, but it seems to work well.\nSearch function on VideoTranslator website  \nSummary Good things are happening, and much more is in the pipeline.

Also for context, our Alexa Rank was 870,350.\nGeneral Plans For 2021 Lots of exciting things are in the works for 2021. In no particular order, we plan to:\n Setup a forum for our clients. The help / tutorials are frequently out of date, because so much of the app is still in active development. Restart email marketing. Due to Covid-19, and part of the team being in lock-down and/or quarantine, we gave up on email marketing. The engagement was pretty poor, but this could have been because we were not adding value. We\u0026rsquo;d like to give this another shot. Move help over to being video based, as opposed to text. We think this will help keep our help content up to date, but we need to work out a nice way to do this. We are working on a super secret project, which may or may not involve launching a multilingual web series in 2021. Stay tuned for more\u0026hellip;  Tech Plans For 2021  We are looking to add a number of languages. Some have already been added, keep on the lookout for the news item describing this! The UI is getting a pretty comprehensive overhaul - this is happening at the moment. We\u0026rsquo;d be keen to launch a mobile version by the end of 2021. Large number of Quality-Of-Life (QOL) additions are slated for Feb/March. Let us know if there is something you really care about!

We use AI to do transcription, translation and synthetic (AI) dubbing.\nThis happens when a client is looking to try out tech and/or better understand the value proposition, or has their own reasons for us to provide this service.\nSometimes however, the most useful thing we can do is just have a conversation.\nThe email and discussion that follows is with Curt Jaimungal, an indie film maker from Toronto, who sent in an email.\nCurt is a very interesting entrepreneur, and you should totally check out his channel - Theories of Everything with Curt Jaimungal!\nThe below images are used with his permission.\nThe Use-Case Use Case: Translating Lectures  \nRight - so what is Curt asking about here?\nThe use case is quite straight forward to understand, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; it would be great if I could simply drag and drop it into a program and it would output the lecturer speaking in English\u0026rdquo;\nIf we were to restate it, the use case here is that the client wants to:\n Upload a German video and have it transcribed. Translate the previously transcribed captions into English. Use an English speaking AI to synthetically dub the content into English and speak it out.  After which, he quite practically asks, \u0026ldquo;Is there an easy drag and drop interface to accomplish this?\u0026rdquo;\nThe ask is totally doable.\nIn fact, this is the exact service we provide managed service clients.\nBut the ask is can the app be used to do this? Absolutely.\nIts just \u0026hellip; not as nice as one would hope\u0026hellip;\nExample Of AI Voice Over, Or Synthetic Dubbing Have a look at this blog post - How QAChef Is Reaching Clients In A Tough Market - it covers the business side of such a process..\nThis is a more fleshed out version of what Curt is asking for - but the blog post looks at this from the point of view of ROI (Return On Investment) and how to use video translation to achieve specific marketing goals.\nYou should totally click on the link if you want to get a better handle on synthetic, or AI, dubbing.\nHow To Convert Your Video From English To German Have a look at this blog post - English To German Video Translation: What is a Babybündel?\nIt covers the mechanical aspects of how the process works, as in what to click within the app.\nThe process is a little ugly at the moment - and is an ongoing priority in our development schedule.\nSend us an email if there is a specific use-case you would like us to cater to for you\u0026rsquo;re preferred workflow.\nWhat do AI voices sound like? So lets say you are reading this blog post, but looking to translate into French or some other language?\nHave a look at this blog post - Samples From A Voice Over Robot: French, German and Dutch - it covers how we use different AI\u0026rsquo;s for different gender effect, age effects etc.\nBut what are the implications of an AI workflow? So we just pointed out how we can do what Curt wants, so why are we saying its messy?\nThree step process for video translation, (1) transcribe, (2) translate, and (3) synthetic voice over  \nTo fully translate a video from German to English, we would do the below.\nUpload the German video and use an AI to transcribe, resulting in a caption file (*.srt).\nAfter this, a human subject matter expert needs to clean up the captions.\nNow, the Text-To-Text translation AI can be used. Again, a human subject matter expert should be used to sanity check the translation.\nFinally, the third AI can be used to provide the synthetic voice over (*.mp4).\nWhat happens without human oversight? \nAs we move up information complexity, the quality of the AI\u0026rsquo;s output gets worse\u0026hellip; but why?\nHigh complexity information is valuable. You pay lots to go to a doctor or lawyer.\nThe information the doctor or lawyer has is scarce. This is why they are expensive - not many people have the skills that the doctor or lawyer has..\nThis scarcity means, there is less information on the internet, to train an AI with - this is why the quality falls a little bit.\nHow Do I Start With Video Translation? How Do I Start With Video Translation?  \nJust start with English (or in this case, German) transcripts - don\u0026rsquo;t translate to begin with\u0026hellip; Why?\nThe value add of captions is all about search.\nSearch engines don\u0026rsquo;t understand audio or video! They only understand text.\nWithout captions, search engines do not know what is in you\u0026rsquo;re video!\nThis is the whole point of VideoTranslator.\nWhen you (later) translate your captions - it means people searching for the video (in their words - i.e. in the other language) will find your video - even though it is still in English!\nEnglish captions only! Practically, use the VideoTranslator app and get the captions.\nMake any changes you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nDownload these as an *.srt file.\nUpload to multiple channels Upload the *.srt to YouTube.\nRead this blog post about how internationalisation can boost ROI, specifically the part about how duration impacts engagement by channel!\nWhat Should A Video Transcription And Translation Workflow Look Like? We can offer advice, or just a sympathetic ear - shout out to my translation friends :) - but this is the question!\nWhat level of ROI do you require, on a per video basis, to invest in the transcription and translation workflow?\nSo - general advice only - reach out and ask for specifics.\nMake small slices of the best bits of the video and use Captions + Auto-Overlay to measure engagement.\nHonestly, all you can do is try, measure, and refine.\nNo silver bullets (or snake oil) here sorry.\n\nThank you very much for the kind words Curt!\nPlease let the team know if we can help out in any other way.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/why-you-should-translate-video-content-a-client-perspective/","tags":["English","German"],"title":"Why Should You Translate Video Content: A Client Perspective"},{"categories":["Accessibility","Video","Transcription","Translation","Video Translation","Video Transcription","Languages","Translation Services"],"contents":"AI is everywhere in the news these days.

In video translation, the first step is a Speech-To-Text AI transcription, the second step is a Text-To-Text AI translation, and the thrid step is a Text-To-Speech AI dubbing.\nWe use Google AI Cloud offering for step 1 and step 3.\nHave a look at the ReviewGeek article about it too!\nMicrosoft Has No Intention Of Being Left Behind In this article - hot off the presses, all of 2 days ago - Microsoft talks about how to use transcription in its Office 365 offering.\n     Transcribe in Word is available today in Word for the web for all Microsoft 365 subscribers    Also very cool.\nSecond full disclosure - videotranslator uses Azure Cloud AI to manage the Text-To-Text AI translation in our application.\nAlso why we keep an eye on the Microsoft blog.

However, the below is a really good image which shows how certain Amazon partners are using the new capabilities.\n     AWS Acqueon AI integration model - source Sheila McGee-Smith    Very cool.\nSo it's cool because we are moving to looking at the innards of how this works, as opposed to hand waving about how awesome AI is. This is a critical point in the how AI is perceived, and hence used, in the real world.\nHow Can Your Business Make Use Of This Explosion In Capability So you probably have either GSuite, MS Office or some similar kind of productivity tool. Are you likely to use these capabilities?\nWell... maybe, I guess.\nI\u0026rsquo;m probably not, at least not immediately.

Yes, but... you still need to do the work to ensure the right content is targeted at the right channels.\nThe other big challenge is this - as we move up information complexity, AI accuracy reduces.\nDo NOT rely only on the AI - this is your business, and its reason for existence is to offer high complexity solutions to specific business problems. AI can help get you there, but is not a substitution for human subject matter experts.\nLet me repeat that - AI is not a substitute for human subject matter experts, and the industry is not remotely close to substituting AI for human judgement.\nConclusion Are you interested in our work?

As a result, the feature is rarely used with less than 0.001% of channels having published community captions (showing on less than 0.2% of watch time) in the last month.  Who Uses YouTube Community Captions Community captions emerged out of a cultural phenomenon known as fansubbing.\nBasically, practice of making fansubs is called fansubbing and is done by a fansubber. Fansubbers typically form groups and divide the work up. The first distribution media of fansubbed material was VHS and Betamax tapes.\nA major use case of fansubbing was translating Korean and Japanese anime for English speaking audiences.\nAre Community Captions Relevant Going Forward So there is clearly a requirement for adding captions/subtitles to video content. But are community captions the way forward?\nWe think the number speak for themselves - so no.\nThat being said, is the YouTube editor a great place to do fansubbing?\nProbably not. There are many creative techniques in fan-subbing which have no direct analogue to captions or subtitles as our client use the technique.\nVideoTranslator clients use subtitles for video SEO.

QAChef\u0026rsquo;s clients are large scale caterers servicing industries like aviation, tourism and restaurant chains - all badly hurt by the slowdown in consumer confidence.\nHow do you convince a big prospect, in the face of a poor outlook, when business risk tolerance is at an all time low?\nIt's all about the relationship.\nWhy Choose AI Video Translation? In QAChef\u0026rsquo;s case, it was to demonstrate commitment to a relationship.\n\u0026quot;We understand you speak a different language from us, this is what we are doing to show you we will back our product in your market.\u0026quot;\nToo many companies from non-English speaking countries have been burnt by smooth talking salesmen who disappeared after making the sale.\nAI Dubbing sets the tone - a commitment to a new relationship.\nRedefine The Relationship Using Language - Service Internationalization/Localization QAChef\u0026rsquo;s clients are global players, and implementing new technology is always part of the context of successful internationalization.\nThere are three ways to implement service level internationalization.\n App Internationalization/Localization Website Internationalization/Localization Marketing Internationalization/Localization  QAChef has a intuitive handheld device, easy enough to use across languages. But the harder thing to internationalize is context.\n    Service Internationalization can include app i18n, website i18n and marketing i18n    What QAChef decided to do was internationalize their marketing efforts.\nFor this, they turned to VideoTranslator\u0026rsquo;s managed services.\nThe Marketing Internationalization/Localization Process Marketing internationalization means taking existing investments in marketing assets, internationalising these into another language and deploying to existing social channels with the appropriate metadata wrappers.\nIn the QAChef case, we worked to translate their existing video content.\nThis was done by (i) video transcription, (ii) video translation and finally (iii) video dubbing.\n    Video Translation is a three step process, transcription, translation and dubbing    This is the original video, and we will look at in Chinese and Arabic.\n  QAChef: CEO Message - Original\n   Video Translation In Chinese / Mandarin   QAChef: CEO Message - Chinese\n   The use case here was as part of a pitch to a global player with a significant mainland China footprint.\nVideo Translation In Arabic   QAChef: CEO Message - Arabic\n   The use case here was as part of a pitch to a major supplier to the aviation industry across the MENA region.\nNotes On Video Translation Its quite important to remember a few rules of thumb when you are doing a video translation.\n As you move up information complexity, the quality of AI gets worse. Why? Because higher complexity information is scarce - so its hard to train an AI on it. Hence you need human subject matter expert post editing. Don't sell the AI dubbed content as human. People are not silly, anyone can tell the difference between a human and a machine. Explain it is an AI - and no one will forget your pitch. If you put your video through a voice translator, the above will not be the output. There is a layer of diacritics being used prior to the AI dubbing.

It\u0026rsquo;s actually a pretty messy question, but here are the basics.\nROI: Return on Investment Getting a definition is the starting point, and according to the smart folks at Investopia:\nReturn on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. ROI tries to directly measure the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost.\nWoo!\nROAS: Return on Ad Spend The good people at https://www.bigcommerce.com.au/ have taken a pretty good approach here:\nReturn On Advertising Spend, (ROAS), is a marketing metric that measures the efficacy of a digital advertising campaign ROAS helps online businesses evaluate which methods are working and how they can improve future advertising efforts.\nBigger Woo! But what does it mean? Essentially, Revenue/Cost or (Revenue-Cost)/Cost.\nNo biggie.\nSo ROI or ROAS? Simple rule of thumb, for total spend go with ROI, for campaign specific spend go with ROAS.\nIt can get a lot more complex. But this is good enough for right now.\nIf you want to know the additional complexity, do research on how to include:\n Partner/Vendor Costs Affiliate Commission Clicks/Impressions Costs  Simple Marketing Funnel vs Simple Business Funnel Okay - this is super basic, but important for the next bit. This is what a basic marketing funnel looks like, contrasted to a business funnel.\n    AI Internationalization: Marketing Funnel vs. Business Funnel    \u0026hellip; And It\u0026rsquo;s Implications For Video So what does it all mean?\n Video should be thought of through the prism of either ROI or ROAS. Thinking it terms of a generic \u0026lsquo;awareness\u0026rsquo; is not going to cut it. Unless if a for-fun project (and you should definitely make videos for fun too!), the big question is what is the expected return of the content spend?, followed up by how to measure this return accurately?  This is actually a pretty deep topic but the focus here is on using subtitling, or video transcription, to boost ROI - that is what you are hear to read about, isn't it!\nBoosting Your Return on Video Spend / Return on Content Spend So we wave our hands magically and assume you have a content spend plan and can measure its returns.\nOnce here, there are 3 ways to boost the return on video, in no particular order:\n Increase engagement frequency Increase engagement duration Increase audience size  Lets look at these in a bit of detail.\nIncrease Engagement Frequency for Video This is primarily applicable to video advertising: from short sub 5, 10, 20, 30 second videos up to maybe about 2 minutes.\nAs an example, these videos are rolled out in video campaign ads, and they play at the start, middle and end of your favourite YouTube videos.\nWithin YouTube there are three different types of ads; Bumper Ads, TrueView in-stream non-skippable ads and TrueView in-stream skippable ads.\nThese are also available in LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram TV.\nHere, subtitles are best used as Open-Captions. Why? Engagement goes up heaps!\n    AI Internationalization: Boost Video Engagement With Open Captions    Research shows that 92% of consumers view videos with the sound off. So in social channels where video auto-plays muted, you really, really need open captions to engage with the viewer.\nIncrease Engagement Duration for Video So this is primarily for longer videos, 5 minutes to 10 minutes long which work on the principle of video SEO.\nThis means you expect your audience to search for specific terms in YouTube and your video comes up in the YouTube Search bar.\nThe first thing you can do is seed keywords into your title and description.\n    AI Internationalization: Seed YouTube specific keywords into the title and description    The second one, and this is a biggie - add subtitles in properly to get the coveted CC tag on your video!\n    AI Internationalization: Add subtitles using the \u0026#39;More Options\u0026#39; tab to boost video SEO!    To get the subtitles file for upload into YouTube, use the Download SRT button. For more advanced use-cases, use the Download VTT button.\nFor a more detailed description of the process, read this blog post or try the VideoTranslator App.\n    AI Internationalization: Download the SRT file for YouTube subtitles, or download the VTT file for more advanced uses cases.    The point is, with the SEO, people will find your content long after your initial campaign is complete.\nIncrease Audience Size Phew! This can be a lot of work. But we\u0026rsquo;re basically done!\nTo increase the audience size we are going after (1) accessibility, and (2) other languages.\nUse the Open Captions as described above to increase accessibility. Who is this aimed at?\nIncrease Audience Size - Accessibility People who are hearing impaired. Do you really care about deaf folk? After all how big of an audience are they?\nYou should care, because it\u0026rsquo;s the right thing to do.\nBut also, older people who may be is various stages of hearing loss - these people potentially have money to spare, so make it easy for them to spend it on your products!\nAdditionally - parents, especially parents of young babies.\nReally? Yes - lots of people use open captions when they have babies. See, if your child is asleep, you want to watch content without waking the baby up!\nThese parents get used to watching content with open captions as a result.\nGo on, be nice to parents everywhere\u0026hellip;\nIncrease Audience Size - Internationalization and Localization This is super useful if the majority of your non-English (as an example) audience is bilingual or multilingual.\nWhat you need to do here is add additional title, description and subtitles files into your video.\n    AI Internationalization: Add additional title, description and subtitle files for each language you want to target    How do you get these? Use the Action -\u0026gt; Translate and select your preferred language to translate to in the VideoTranslator App.\n    AI Internationalization: Pick the appropriate language and dialect    Conclusion We used the VideoTranslator to obtain (1) subtitles or transcripts, (2) an open-caption version, and (3) title, descriptions and subtitles in different languages, for our video content.\nThe key points are:\n  Boost engagement frequency for shorter video adverts, and engagement duration for longer bits of content using Video SEO tactics described above.\n  Distribute your content to a wider audience, and be nice to your parents!\n  Please connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/ai-internationalization-how-subtitling-can-boost-roi/","tags":["English"],"title":"How Subtitling Can Boost ROI"},{"categories":["Retail","Video","Transcription","Translation","Accessibility","Languages"],"contents":"Today we look at AI localisation. Essentially, how to use AI to reach a broader market at scale.\nIts a really simple question. Does AI Localisation work at scale?\nAs always, the answer is yes and no, but mostly it depends on what you are trying to do.\nThe context is this: localisation project managers often burn themselves out by performing tons of routine operations every single day.\nSo the question becomes, how to use AI localisation at scale, and then, how to best use AI in localisation efforts at the process level?\nDoes AI Localisation Work At Scale? By at scale we mean if you need to translate content regularly and use translators. And we narrow our question to media translation specifically.\nGiven the sheer number of AI\u0026rsquo;s which can be used for translation, and the number of available languages, the answer is yes - AI does work at scale and its pretty good.\nWhat Challenges Does AI Localisation Face? Ok - not really.\nAssuming a standard Speech-To-Text AI (for the transcription), or a standard Text-To-Text AI (for the translation), this is how you want to think about it.\n    AI Localisation: As we move up information complexity the quality of AI translation gets worse    So (a) if the content is gossip, AI will probably be pretty good, (b) it'll be less good for say medical or legal content, (c) when it comes to quantum physics best of luck!\nThe higher the information complexity, the worse an AI will perform.\nThe reason is fairly simple. Complex information is inherently more valuable, and so less common on the Internet. Hence it is very hard to train an AI to work with the complex information.\nHow To Use AI On Your Projects With Confidence? Use AI to assist your people, not replace your people.\n    AI Localisation: A productivity tool, not a human replacement    The workflow you should be thinking about is:\n Upload your content and transcribe: Use AI to do the first pass transcription and a human subject matter expert to post-edit. Upload your content and translate: Use AI to do the first pass translation and a human subject matter expert to post-edit.  How Does VideoTranslator Simplify The Post-Editing Process?     AI Localisation: Tools to make your post-editing quicker!    So this is what you want to do:\n Pop out the video to PiP so you can easily scroll as you make edits. Try to make nice sentences - no one want to read a single word fragment. The way to think about Open Captions is like so - you want nice 4/5 word sentences which are easy to read, not single word like \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; as shown in the image. Time fragments should be a minimum of 1 second long, ideally 1.5 seconds or so, to make it easy to read quickly.  The number of edits you make is called the edit distance, or edit delta, and it refers to the number of changes post AI before a finished product is ready.\nConclusion We use the VideoTranslator to add transcripts to our video content.\nThe key points are:\n  Use the AI as a first pass before your subject matter expert to increase productivity.\n  AI's are best used to simplify and speed up workflow. They should not primarily be used to replace staff.\n  AI will fail in localisation without the use of subject matter experts, especially as your content moves up information complexity.\n  Please connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/ai-localisation-help-me-help-you/","tags":["English"],"title":"AI Localisation: Help Me Help You"},{"categories":["Retail","Video","Transcription","Translation","Accessibility","Languages"],"contents":"This post is dedicated to simple rules to maximise your SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) impact with video content.\nThere are 4 things you need to do to maximise your video content\u0026rsquo;s SEO impact. They are, title, description, keywords and the transcript, we will look at each one of these in detail.\nWhy Do Video SEO? From this DeepCrawl article, search engines cannot index video content. This is because search engines can only index text content.\nEdit: Stop!\nAlso have a look at this newer article by the folks at Amplitude Agency about how search engines work for a high level overview of what search engines care about.\nSo we literally need to tell the search engine what our video content is about!\nThis is why we need to distribute video content optimised for SEO.\nHow To Optimise A Video Title? You have two goals in your video title - target keywords and maximising click through (CTR).\n Make sure your include your target keyword ONCE in the title. Create a compelling title!  Don't use a click bait title. YouTube will penalise you if you have low retention numbers!\nBonus Tip: Use eye-catching thumbnails with at least one human in them!\nHow To Optimise A Video Description?     Video SEO: YouTube displays the first 125 characters of your description in the search results.    Your first 125 characters should drive click through to your video!\nIn the above image you can see that the title, description and thumbnail are very important to CTR numbers.\nHow To Optimise Keywords? Ok - without getting into too much detail. The easiest way to work out keywords is to do the grunt work!\nWe can do this in Google, where you start typing the words you care about, and the auto-fill kicks in:\n    Video SEO: Google displays some suggestions    And you do this for YouTube also:\n    Video SEO: YouTube offers different suggestions    In both the above examples, we type in \u0026quot;amazing\u0026quot; as our first word, and then go \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; etc etc.\nWhy are the suggestions offered by Google different from the suggestions offered by YouTube?\nBecause people search for different things on Google vs. YouTube! This means depending on where you are putting out your content, optimising for different keywords is super important.\nHow To Optimise The Transcript There are two ways to optimise your transcript. We used QuickTranscribe to get the transcription.\n We use the VideoTranslator\u0026rsquo;s SRT download option to get the *.srt file which we use for subtitles.      Video SEO: Add the SRT downloaded from VideoTranslator to your YouTube video     We used the VideoTranslator\u0026rsquo;s Auto-Overlay feature to create a Open Captions version of our video. The below image is from Matija Squire, a good friend of VideoTranslator!      Video SEO: Use the Open Captions version as above for accessibility    When would we use Open-Captions?  We use open captions in social media channels where the video auto-plays muted, such as LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook. We use open captions where accessibility is a concern.

Being able to see and use facial expressions when communicating is extremely important in ASL and an extremely difficult thing to do if half of your face is covered due to a mask.\nSo, using her and her mum\u0026rsquo;s craftiness to good use, they have created masks with plastic windows that allow the users mouth to be seen.\n\u0026quot;\u0026lsquo;I felt like there was a huge population that was being looked over,\u0026quot; Lawrence said. \u0026lsquo;We\u0026rsquo;re all panicking right now and so a lot of people are just not being thought of. So, I felt like it was very important that, even at a time like this, people need to have that communication.'\u0026quot;\nRead the full story here\n3. How AI Can Determine Which Coronavirus Patients Require Hospitalisation A leading healthcare company in the US, Jvion is developing an AI project which is undertaking data to better understand how patients will or won\u0026rsquo;t react to treatment for COVID-19. The aim is to be able to determine which patients will need to be hospitalized and who can stay at home to safely recover. This will in turn could reduce the capacity of patients in hospitals and give the overworked nurses and doctors a little relief.\n\u0026ldquo;Jvion’s approach helps [to] determine individual risk levels while using minimal or no clinical data and using limited patient-level information that doesn’t require special medical equipment. This will make it possible to leverage the AI to study large populations and determine high-risk patients without flooding medical centers.\u0026quot;\nRead the full story here\n4.

Jessie Kanacharoen first created a YouTube video to inform her friends and family about the risks of COVID-19 and to encourage them to stay at home as much as possible.\nJessie was aware that a lot of people she knew in Thailand were not being given the correct information regarding the virus and so she produced a video with Thai subtitles, to make it easy for them to understand.\n\u0026ldquo;In just seven minutes, \u0026ldquo;The Real Deal on Covid-19\u0026rdquo; explains, in simple language, many of the most pressing questions people have about the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including what the pandemic designation means, how the disease is transmitted, what its symptoms are, how it affects the elderly and immunocompromised, what it means to be an asymptomatic carrier, and the effectiveness of social distancing techniques at slowing the spread.\u0026quot;\nThe video was a viral hit and was soon shared by the Thai Medical Society, it was shown on Thai television and was translated into local Thai dialects so that the information was even more readily available for those who need it.\nView the video here\nRead the full story here\n5.

Or Are you a court reporter looking for an easy way to caption lots of content? This blog post might be for you.\nHaving captions is very useful these days. Its really good for engagement, and its also really good for accessibility - specifically hearing impaired folk.\nHowever, and there is no getting around this, it is painful to do.\nManual audio or video transcription takes ages. For a transcription professional it takes about 4x - so for a 15 minute video it takes 1 hour to transcribe.\nBut this is only really true when the complexity of the content is low or the transcriber has a high degree of familiarity with the content.\nWhat Is The Best Subtitling Software? It depends. Sorry. There is no simple answer.\nActually - its video translator - our product is the best subtitling software! Ok it probably isn\u0026rsquo;t, but it might be :)\nThe answer depends on a number of factors. Lets talk about them one by one.\nBudget - Free AI Transcription Software Free software exists such as the Google AI suite but you would not be here if that worked for you. Basically the answer varies with how much money you are willing to spend.\nThe bottom line - a hybrid solution of AI with human post-editing is rapidly becoming the preferred choice - but who does the post editing, how secure is it, and what kind of accuracy can you expect?\nBtw - here is a blog post about the kind of security concerns with online transcription.\nLike I said - budget.\nSo your options are:\n (1) manually transcribing with subject matter expert (really good + really expensive) (2) AI transcribing with human input (cheap but uncertain quality) (3) AI transcribing + your own people post-editing (cheap + really good but your own staff time)  Video translator (thats us!) is a option (3) play.\nWe think using AI + trusted staff or contractors is a really nice mix of both worlds. That way you get to bring your own subject matter experts, and use our tech in a cheap and scalable manner.\nAccuracy In AI Transcription - How Good Is AI Transcription Really? Its pretty good. The thing to understand is that as your content moves up in information complexity, the AI gets worse.\nPractically this means that if your content is about gossip - no worries. But given you are probably trying to sell stuff with content marketing this means that important stuff may be incorrect.\nSecond point. Generally subtitling software uses generic AI. At video translator we use a proprietary language-dialect mapping system to increase accuracy. We have several English, Spanish and Arabic dialects to help out.\n English dialect samples here Arabic dialect samples here  AI Accuracy And How To Think About What You Are Paying For\u0026hellip; We wrote an entire post about it - check it out for more details.\n     AI Transcription, Translation And Dubbing: How To Think About Accuracy    Time - How Long Does AI Transcription Take? With the majority of online transcription and online translation providers turn around time is a factor. Some are very quick.\nBut what are the chances that someone turning around on a deadline will aim for quality?\nUnlikely.\nShould you internalize with our AI tools? That is a hard question to answer, but if your value proposition is directly linked to your bottom line - yeah you probably should.\nVideo Translator is real time AI transcription, real time AI translation and real time AI dubbing. You do the work, when you want to.\nWhat does real time mean - practically seconds to minutes. That is if its a 2 GB file it'll take longer than if its a 20 mb file.\nShort files are the quickest (seconds). That being said, you probably want to use short videos because traction numbers show they work better.\n For YouTube ~10 minutes works best For LinkedIn average time a video is watched is 7 seconds  Different stuff works differently.

Essentially Automated is not that good, and Human carries privacy and security risks.\nThis story by GigaOm and this story by cyber security journalist Brian Krebs highlight the risks involved.\nIn the first story freelance workers in Pakistan did not get paid and so started messing with the transcripts, and in the second a number of medical records were leaked. Note: this was sourced from Matt Hughes story in How-To-Geek, you should read it.\nSo what can you do?\nThe VideoTranslator Model We think that hybrid is best, and ideally you should do it yourself. Why?\nThe simple answer is this - as we move up information complexity AI transcription gets worse.\nMore valuable information, such as your value proposition is by definition scarce on the Internet.

China is a very large market for online video.

So video translator can be considered a chinese clipping app, or realistically an any language clipping app. Why are we doing this?\nThe short answer is SEO. It all starts with the humble *.vtt, or Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT) format file. From the fantastic Mozilla Developer website, we see the below.\n    Clipping Chinese App: Web Video Text Tracks Format (WebVTT) is where it is at!    What are we looking at?

One of the research team has a YouTube channel, so this is a sample below.\n  How AI Dubbing Will Change Everything: Face To Face Translation Sample\n   While the technology is very cool, its not something we really do. The approach we have taken is quite different.\nVideo Translator: Speech-To-Speech Translation (Our App!) So how is this technology different to what is happening here at video translator?\n    How AI Dubbing Will Change Everything: VideoTranslator\u0026#39;s Speech-To-Speech Translation    So what we are doing is we expect human intervention at (1) and (2). That is:\n Do a Speech-To-Text AI Transcription (human post-editing expected) With the transcript do a Text-To-Text Translation (human post-editing expected) With the translated transcript, do a Text-To-Speech Dubbing (human post-editing expected)  Generally this means the end-to-end flow is better suited for assets which are expected to be online for a long time. Hence we put in the extra effort into making the asset really nice.\nWhat do such assets look like? This is an English video a client recently provided us.\n  How AI Dubbing Will Change Everything: English Original\n   This is the AI Vietnamese version.\n  How AI Dubbing Will Change Everything: AI Vietnamese Translation\n   Obviously the work that IIIT-H has done is a scientific paper, whereas you can try our technology for free, because its a production Saas app.\nCheap too! :)\nWhich Is Better? Clearly we are biased, and we think our approach is superior. But lets talk about why?\nOur clients report that you always want to over-disclose with AI.\nOk, here is what is happening. You always want to tell people it is an AI. This is because if they don't know, most people feel like you are trying to fool them somehow. And then they react badly.\nBasically AI Dubbing is pretty good, but its NOT that good. So a human will always work out that something is up. If you do not disclose, people get cranky.\nDisclosing its an AI is very good. Mostly because normal people (outside tech) are excited about technology, so will (paradoxically) pay more attention. That is, we get a win when we disclose, and people are cranky when you do not disclose.\nThe lip-syncing is a very cool feature, but comes awfully close to fake news, and communities worldwide have deep concerns (totally legitimate concerns too!) about fake news.\nNo really - disclose that you are using an AI!\nWe think you need standards/regulation, and lip syncing with AI is probably not going to reassure the community. That being said, if properly disclosed, there is almost certainly a place for this new technology.\nWe wish the team at IIIT-H the best, and hopefully we see their tech out in the wild sooner rather than later. Best of luck gents, and very nicely done!\nConclusion Curious about how we could help your business? Check out our managed service, or try our app for free!

Several companies have been coming out with new products to meet this requirement.\nWhat does it mean? Does it work? How to evaluate these products? We take a look and try to think behind the hype.\nFirst we look at some of the incoming offerings. Then some issues with AI Transcription and Translation.\nIncoming Offerings There is a very large number of AI products hitting the market place. Here are a few examples of what is happening.\nGoogle Translate To Add Real-Time Transcription Feature Earlier this month Silicon Angle posted this article about how Google is going to be adding a real time transcription feature.\nHere is the money quote, “Your mobile phone effectively turns into a language translator for long-form speech,” Sami Iqran (pictured), product manager for Google Translate, told SiliconANGLE in an interview at a press event Wednesday in San Francisco.\nImportantly, also from the same article, The feature sounds a bit similar to the Live Transcribe app on Android, which is aimed at the hearing-impaired and allows them to see a transcription of people’s speech on their smartphones. However, that app cannot translate speech into another language.\nCisco Integrates Voicea Transcription AI into Voice Assistant From the VoiceBot website, which you should totally check out for very interesting AI news, came this article.\nWhat Cisco says about their new product, “Voicea users have reported saving more than six hours per week per user with more actionable and efficient meetings – and we believe Webex users will experience similar results,” Cisco senior vice president Sri Srinivasan said in a statement. “We’re excited to bring this and other cognitive features to the 300 million users we already serve with Cisco Collaboration. This technology will fundamentally change how we are able to deliver massively personalized experiences and transform the way we work.”\nSo this is an interesting offering in a couple of different ways. Cisco is marketing this as a AI Secretarial Service. So the idea here is:\n Use the AI to transcribe the content Users can tag key moments, and there is some kind of mechanism to follow up Using another mechanism further conversation points can be followed up on  Not having seen the product or worked on it, we have no idea what kind of traction will happen here. But lots of interesting ideas here from Cisco.\nMicrosoft’s AI Automatically Comments On Video Clips Venture Beat has another bit of news from earlier this month. The basic idea is, Generating live video captions with AI could bolster engagement on social media ...\nOk - that kind of makes sense. But it seems an awful lot like, lets get AI\u0026rsquo;s commenting on our content, and maybe someone will be fooled and start commenting on it too.\nThat may be a bit of a cynical viewpoint but that is what it sounds like to me.\nBut giving these folks the benefit of the doubt, the team from Microsoft Research Asia and Harbin Institute of Technology came up with a new model which, iteratively learns to capture the representations among comments, video, and audio, and they say that in experiments, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nIn fairness, the code is available on GitHub, so might be worth checking out.\nWe have not yet done this, so please be aware of that when reading our take on it. Why have we not done this? Because the last commit is from December 2018, so\u0026hellip;\nThere is a pretty cool picture though. The below is just a screenshot from the same article.\n    How AI Transcription Fails And What To Do About It: AI generated comments from MS Research    But we should not be too cynical here as the researchers admit this is a interesting project, “[W]e believe the multimodal pre-training will be a promising direction to explore, where tasks like image captioning and video captioning will benefit from pre-trained models,” wrote the researchers. “For future research, we will further investigate the multimodal interactions among vision, audio, and text in … real-world applications.”\nCool - even if the use case is a bit of a mystery and the project seems to be dead on Github.\nWhat Does It Mean? And Does It Work? AI Transcription is obviously a hot space for new product and research. And here at video translator our product is obviously in the same space.\nAlso, in the world of AI, never say never, because technology is moving very fast. That being said, we feel there are two major issues with the majority of AI transcription products available today.\nThis is not to say AI transcription/translation does not work - it absolutely does, when used properly.\nIssue 1: AI Transcription Fails Because Of the Differences In Languages Vs Dialects The first issue is language vs dialects. People speak in different dialects. What are you going to do?\nIn the VideoTranslator app we have an explicit language-dialect mapping which allows the user to specify the specific dialect which the content should be transcribed with - the example below shows the AI dialect options for English.\n    How AI Transcription Fails And What To Do About It: Language-Dialect Mapping    Now this is not to say a more general AI (in terms of its training corpus) cannot get a really good transcript.\nHowever, we find that using the specific AI on a dialect basis results in higher accuracy. This is also not entirely surprising for obvious reasons.\nIssue 2: AI Transcription Fails As We Move Up Information Complexity So this is a bit hard to explain. AI\u0026rsquo;s are trained on a corpus (data set). So a transcription AI is trained with lots of sound files, and a translation AI with lots of text files.\nThis is the problem, high information complexity content, is by definition, not that common. Hence the more complex a subject is, the less likely this content is in the corpus used to train the AI.\nThink about it this way, for a gossip column the AI will probably be pretty good; for medical information, the AI will be less good; for quantum physics, yeah ... nah.\nBut higher information complexity content is precisely what is valuable.\nAgain, higher information complexity content is precisely what makes the information valuable, in fact, the higher the complexity, generally speaking, the more valuable it is.\nThis is why your doctor can charge you lots of money, or your lawyer, or accountant. Because they have higher information complexity knowledge in their heads. You are paying for the time they spent learning the subject matter.\nThis is why many of these AI\u0026rsquo;s don\u0026rsquo;t work so well.\nAt VideoTranslator, we explicitly sell our product as an efficiency win, not a cost saving. You really want a human subject matter expert (i.e. good old human judgement!) to finesse your transcript or translation.\nConclusion AI Transcription is very capable, and with the right use-cases, can lead to really big productivity wins. This means you can increase the quality of the transcription or translation depending upon what you are trying to do. We hope this post shows you some of the things to think about when choosing your preferred AI toolkit.\nRemember: Use the VideoTranslator AI's for the heavy lifting, and your own staff to do high value tasks. Practically this means your staff can think more about engagement and converting clients, as opposed to manually doing the first pass transcription or translation.\nCurious about how we could help your business?

This week we had a few stories come by which show much progress is being made in the popularity of regional languages.\nHere at VideoTranslator we feel that most people are quite proud of where they come from - its totally natural.\nEach one of us has a story of how we came to be, and the stories of those who came before are a vital part of any human identity. This week we have two such stories.\nWe are also experimenting with more video, so here is a sample! Let us know what you think!\n  One Igbo Woman Trying To Save Her Language\n   One Igbo Woman Trying To Save Her language This article from the Nigerian Vanguard newspaper covers one such story.\nOnyinye Ibelegbu, the CEO of the NwaadaIgbo Language School is working to save indigenous Nigerian languages from extinction.\n    One Woman Trying To Save Her Mother Tongue: Onyinye Ibelegbu, from Vanguard Nigeria    The model was first pioneered by her in her mother tongue Igbo. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;At the time I left ZINOX, I had signed up on international teaching platforms. I also signed up on Tuterial as an Igbo Language teacher. I notice, however, that the demand for Igbo Language teaching was very high.\u0026rdquo;\nNice! This paragraph is illuminating however, I remember that we got punished as students for speaking our mother tongue which was tagged ‘vernacular’ at school. That affected the growth of our indigenous languages greatly. I however think it starts from the home. Yes, our national language is English, but that doesn’t mean we won’t grow our indigenous languages.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; The Hausa Language is faring better. The average Hausa person will ask you why you cannot speak Hausa and will tell you that you’re supposed to speak her language since you are on her land. I learned the language while working there because they are a people who either do not care to speak English or who don’t know how to. And no matter how wealthy a Hausa man is, Hausa Language is always the language of communication in his home.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is true - within the VideoTranslator we have Hausa, but we do not have Igbo. We wish Onyinye Ibelegbu best of luck! Reach her here and check out her Udemy course in Igbo here!\nWhat Does Igbo Look Like? Google was our friend here, and we found these fantastic images of what Igbo is right now.\n    One Woman Trying To Save Her Mother Tongue: What does Igbo look like?    And this is also very cool, what Igbo might one day look like!\n    One Woman Trying To Save Her Mother Tongue: What could Igbo look like?    Tasmania Supports Vision For Aboriginal Languages To Be Taught To All Students Tasmanian Education Minister Jeremy Rockliff is looking to have children learn a little bit of the local Aboriginal languages, reports The Advocate from Hobart.\nThe idea is to promote reconciliation, and with any luck this is a positive step forward.\nFrom the article, \u0026ldquo;They want their language to be brought to the surface in a respectful way and like to have ownership over where it can be used and need to be given respect over how it is used.\u0026rdquo;\n    VISION: Jeremy Rockliff speaking at the Reconcilliation Tasmania launch of education programs for 2020. Picture Phillip Biggs    \u0026ldquo;For them to give permission to non-Aboriginal people is part of that journey.\u0026rdquo;\nAt VideoTranslator we think this is a very interesting development. Aboriginal languages are very hard to use (with computers) as much of the infrastructure is missing.\nAdditionally the majority of Aboriginal languages are dialects, and there is a large number of these dialects which are basically dying out. If you are interested in looking up more information we recommend this website run by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies(AIATSIS).\nConclusion Please connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nCurious about how we could help your business?

And one of the better resources out there is Social Media Today. This article, \u0026lsquo;What Gen Z is Watching Online - and What That Means for Marketers in 2020\u0026rsquo; is full of wonderful titbits about how to think about video.\nHow Gen Z Is Using YouTube The big takeaway from the article is that Vlogging and Informative Videos are the biggest draws.\nVlogging has become far more professional in the last few years since YouTube launched its YouTube Partnership Program.\nReading a bit more, including from this article we work out that:\nGen Z Learns How to Do Something by Watching Videos Gen Z is watching experts do something on YouTube to learn how to do it themselves.\nAccording to GenHQ\u0026rsquo;s national study from 2017, 85% of Gen Z watched at least one online video in the past week to learn a new skill.\nGen Z Discovers New Brands and Products on YouTube Basically Gen Z discovers new products by watching YouTube influencers. Influencers are often not what we think they are - here at VideoTranslator we are big fans of Justin Rhodes.\n    Source: Justin Rhodes Permaculture Pigs Kickstarter    Well - probably just me, but hey! Get on them Permaculture Pigs. The image is from his Kickstarter.\nThe point is, influencers are people who have their own content channel about something they are experts in, in the above case the expert is a family man who decided to change his families way of living to something sustainable.\nThe takeaway is, Gen Z has far more access to authentic experts across the different fields of human endeavour. Seen this way, the reliance on influencers is probably not a passing fad.\nHow To Use AI To Reach Gen Z The simple answer is to optimise search for video. That is, use AI to transcribe your content, and optionally translate your content. Once you have the captions (in *.srt, or *.vtt) you can do many things!\nThere are a few simple ways of doing this.\nUse Open Captions To Make Your Content Accessible Open captions are a simple way to reach a wider audience while meeting accessibility requirements.\nIn the VideoTranslator use the Auto Overlay feature to do this quickly and easily.\nUse Open Captions To Engage More People     Reach Gen Z With AI: Open Captions for fun and profit!    This is simple. use open captions to engage people on social media, especially social media channels where video content auto-plays muted.\nRemember to change the colours to match your brand!\nVTT On Your Website We have a patch coming out soon which will talk more about this in the future. Here is what you need to know.\nVTT files are super similar to *.srt files. But where SRT does not work with HTML 5, VTT is designed to work with the video tag in HTML 5.\nThis means that your video content can be indexed by search engines. Make sure you do this properly!\nConclusion What sources of information do you track to learn more about the advances in AI?

Because the user is not being paid to use the product (or being told to by their manager) expectations for the product are totally different.\nThis is a challenge from a product perspective. On the plus side, the feedback means that the product becomes much much better, and we can take risks and see what works.\nOn the negative side, clients are not invested in you, so the feedback can be blunt to put it mildly.

We use AI to do transcription, translation and synthetic (AI) dubbing - we are technologists who are trying to service our clients to the best of our ability.\nEvery now and then a story turns up which brings a lot of our work into sharp focus. This week we look at a hearing impaired couple from Arizona who are suing their healthcare provider.\nArizona Couple Sues Their Healthcare Provider From the Ahwatukee Foothills News we get this story. An Arizona couple are taking their healthcare provider, Dignity Health and its Chandler Regional Medical Centre to federal court over what they consider to be a lack of interpretive services for deaf patients.\nThe information in the story says that the couple has been waiting more than five years to resolve a civil complaint for practices they think are discriminatory against the deaf community.\n    Accessibility: Arizona couple Mitchell and Dawn Siegel, sourced from AFN    From the article, \u0026ldquo;Dawn Siegel visited Dignity’s Chandler Regional Medical Center in 2014 for severe stomach pains and claims she was not provided a sign language interpreter who could translate what doctors and nurses were telling her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She was instructed to write down what she needed to tell hospital staff or communicate through an off-site interpreter via webcam video.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Siegel found the video service ineffective due to poor visual quality and the interpreter’s inabilities. She claims her requests for a certified, in-person interpreter were not granted during her nine-day hospital visit, resulting in Siegel never wanting to return.\u0026rdquo;\nCan You Get Sued For Not Providing Accessible Services? \u0026ldquo;The Siegels were among a group of deaf individuals who joined together in 2014, to sue Dignity Health for violating protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act obligates health providers to “effectively communicate” with deaf people.\u0026rdquo;\nSo you probably can get sued. As technologists, we have no idea if there is merit to the lawsuit, and clearly we do not have many facts at all.\nBut yes, you can get absolutely sued. Whether this will hold up in court is a different matter, and not something we can comment on.\nIs The Couple Justified In Suing Their Healthcare Provider? Again, on this specific case, we cannot comment seeing as we do not know the details.\nMore generally, is there limited support available to people with disabilities? We think most reasonable people can agree with that sentiment.\nThe challenge is that providing disability friendly facilities is hard to think about, complex to do and expensive to implement.\nHow Can You Use AI To Provide A Better Outcome, And Increase Engagement VideoTranslator allows you to use AI to do two things which can help with providing better disability friendly facilities.\nBut first some context, people want to feel empowered to make good decisions, and providing them access to relevant information is the key here.\nHow To Add Open Captions To Your Video Adding Open Captions is one of the simplest ways to reach the hearing impaired community.\nThe heuristic is pretty simple:\n Use an AI to transcribe your video. Use the Auto-Overlay feature to bake in, or burn in, your captions into the video.  This article about the Quick Transcribe feature covers the process.\nHow To Make Your Video Disability Friendly / Accessible Assume the video content is going to be deployed on your website, and social media channels.\nThe key idea is to make sure the transcript is also in the description. So what you need to do is grab the transcript and make sure you are adding that information into the description/metadata fields of your preferred social media channels.\nOnce you have used the AI to transcribe your video, you need to get the captions without any time stamp codes.\n    Accessibility: (Before) Transcript with timestamps    Use the Hide Timestamps button to get the transcript without the timestamps and then copy the content to use on social media.\n    Accessibility: (After) Transcript with timestamps    Deploying Your Asset With Open Captions If you have used the Auto-Overlay feature to add Open Captions the outcome will look something like below - you can also use the translate feature here for reaching your preferred target demographic.\n    Accessibility: Another example of Open Captions - note the font/colour is fully editable    Hopefully the above was useful in showing you how to make your video content disabled friendly. Spending the time/money to make this happen is good for your stakeholders, and proven to increase engagement, so it\u0026rsquo;s well worth it!\nConclusion We don\u0026rsquo;t have any specific legal qualifications, and no idea if you will or will not be sued.

This industry has many different participants, and they use our technology in different ways.\nAs a software firm, the hardest thing is to really understand what our clients do and why they do these things. Sounds funny, but it is true.\nWe had a strong response to our previous article, 3x Increase In Transcription Efficiency, and a number of questions and suggestions.\nThe majority of suggestions were along the lines of how the app was messy to use. In today\u0026rsquo;s blog post, we look at the new Quick Transcribe functionality - a no frills way to get what you need to do done.\nQuick Transcribe - What Are Clients Trying To Use VideoTranslator For? Quick Transcribe was built to serve a specific need - engagement and accessibility.\n    Quick Transcribe: Clients are using VideoTranslator for accessibility and engagement! Font, size, colour and transparency are fully customisable!    Quick Transcribe - Accessibility We recently had really bad bush fires in Australia, and fire-fighters are still looking at a tough fire season. A major part of what the RFS goes during this period is communicate with the community about what actions they should take.\nThen this happened.\n    Quick Transcribe: Accessibility is hard to do well, even more so in emergency situations    The point being made was how can hearing impaired people access video information. Historically the solution has been Auslan (Australian Sign Language).\nBut this is really hard in a situation where you have massive bush fires burning.\nIncrease Engagement On Your Video Content This is pretty simple - having open captions in you video means better engagement on social media platforms.\nPractically, most social media auto-plays video content muted - this is why open captions are useful.\nQuick Transcribe - How Does It Work? The idea was how to make it super simple. As few clicks as possible. Assuming you are already logged in or have just signed up for the free-trial.\nStep 1: Click On The Quick Transcribe button     Quick Transcribe: Click on the quick transcribe button    Step 2: Upload Your Video Using Drag And Drop     Quick Transcribe: Upload your video using drag and drop, adding a link, or import from your Google Drive or MS OneDrive    Step 3: Select Your Preferred Language And Dialect     Quick Transcribe: Select your preferred language and dialect    Remember: Selecting the correct dialect is super important - this affects the quality of the AI transcription.\nHere is how to think about it. An AI is not human, and gets easily confused. Be nice to our computer friends.\nCongratulations: Your Video Has Been AI Transcribed! Below we have resized the video so the image came out nicely.

You Still Need To Clean Up The Transcript (Post-Editing) The process of fixing up an AI transcript (or AI translation, or AI dubbing) is known as post-editing.\nKey in the changes, and the overlay will show you what it looks like instantly.\n    Quick Transcribe: Click on the Captions button and edit the AI captions, this is called post editing    Quick Transcribe: What To Do Once Your Video Has A Transcript There are a few options:\n Download the *.srt file and use this in the Closed Captions for YouTube.      Quick Transcribe: Download the SRT file for use in Closed Captions     Use Auto-Overlay to bake the captions in - this is called Open Captions.      Quick Transcribe: Open Captions with a highlight using Auto-Overlay     We used Montserrat, black text, and 255,255,0 yellow for the highlight, with a transparency of 0.8.

Here at video translator we like to keep abreast of the latest news in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Programming, Human Languages and Culture.\nRead on to find out how Facebook\u0026rsquo;s AI got in trouble, and why Oracle thinks replacing your manager with a robot is likely, and a good thing to boot!\nFacebook\u0026rsquo;s AI Got In Trouble This Week From this article at Gizmodo we get a funny story. The below picture says it all.\n    Mr Sh*thole: Facebooks AI gets in trouble...    Is this your nightmare?\nHow To Avoid AI Disasters? The following rules of thumb are really useful in terms of avoiding AI disasters.\n  Do not assume AI is a replacement for sound human judgement. The fact of the matter is, irrespective of whether we wish it or not, AI is sold as a replacement for humans with all the lovely lovely cost savings that implies.\n  Do not buy into this myth. While it may be possible that AI will seem like a viable replacement for good, well paid employees, this is absolutely a fools paradise.\n  Here is a simple way to think about it If replacing humans were so easy, very simple jobs would get automated first. What\u0026rsquo;s the simplest job? Flipping burgers at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s? There is a very good reason why this is hard and has not been automated. If you think your job is harder than flipping burgers at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, chances are AI can\u0026rsquo;t replace you.\n  How To Use AI Properly? When we talk to clients (especially on the managed service offering) this question comes up. Here is the reality, your AI usage has to be calibrated to your own organisations risk profile.\n  We do a lot of work for healthcare providers. The translated video content we provide the concerns is always checked before being released to the public. Why? Because in healthcare content, getting it wrong might kill someone.\n  Use the AI as a productivity win. Do not think of it as a cost saving. This has the added advantage of not pissing your customers off.\n      Mr Not Sh*thole: Don\u0026#39;t go after someone else\u0026#39;s crust    But there is good news on the horizon\u0026hellip;\nHumans May Prefer Robot Overlords According to this bit of research from Oracle, 64% of People Trust a Robot More Than Their Manager. Bugger.\nIs this good or bad? Neither we think. Its simply a reflection of a changing world. To create better working spaces and better in-aggregate living standards, we see a world where AI acts in conjunction with humans.\nPeople are tool makers, and AI is just another tool. Sure it is a tool which has a remarkable ability to be misused, but this makes is no different from our more impressive tools.\nQuoting, AI is becoming more prominent with 50 percent of workers currently using some form of AI at work compared to only 32 percent last year. Workers in China (77 percent) and India (78 percent) have adopted AI over 2X more than those in France (32 percent) and Japan (29 percent).\nAI should not be thought of as a my-way-or-the-highway binary outcome by people. Understanding what AI can do, and how it can improve your earning power is a better approach.\nConclusion Please connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nCurious about how we could help your business?

This was due to a previous issue where audio and video uploads failed inside a fileItem with a space in its name. This has now been fixed.\nDetails: Spaces In FileTemplate And FileItem Names  Click on a fileTemplate, and then click the New Item button. Note this is the Arabic template.      Patch Notes January 2020: Click on the Arabic template and create a new item for video translation     This creates the new fileItem. The upload questions are in Arabic.      Patch Notes January 2020: The modal now allows filenames with spaces    January 2020: Transcription Without Time-Coding Previously, there was no easy way to extract the captions without manually removing the timestamps from the source *.srt content.\nIn the below image, the captions are visible. To extract these captions without the time coding information, it was necessary to\n Select the content Ctrl-a Copy the content Ctrl-c Paste into MS Word or similar text editor Ctrl-v Manually edit out the timestamps for the content data only.      Patch Notes January 2020: Captions are shown in a sample video, which is also visible in the picture-in-picture    An enhancement has now been put in place.

This allows the user to copy the contents of the *.srt source, with or without time-codes.\nPlease ensure that the correct source is selected when you are using this functionality.\n    Patch Notes January 2020: Captions can be copied using the Copy To Clipboard button, and a notification appears.    January 2020: Edit/Exit Modals Removed/Modified A number of selection modals have been removed or set to timers. Previously, when the user tried to go into a FileTemplate or FileItem by clicking the Edit button a modal asking for a confirm would appear - this has now been removed.\nAdditionally, when triggering a transcription, translation or dubbing action, a modal confirming and allowing the user to exit would show. Now, this modal is set to a timer and auto exits.\nJanuary 2020: Fixes To Locking The locking function has been the source of a reasonable amount of confusion, and it does not help the function had a bug.\nEarlier, to unlock a file, the user had to exit using the file menu. Now, clicking on Root, or MyTeam, will also properly unlock the fileTemplate or fileItem.\nJanuary 2020: Cosmetic Fixes To Billing Inside the app, there were are number of hints to how to use the billing. This information is presented in the billing section. Many of these hints were outdated.\nOriginally, our pricing model was $10/language-month + a balance for AI usage.

In this thought provoking article, Mary Lou Jespen explains how projects like the Earth Species Project are working on developing AI systems that will decipher what large animals (think whales and elephants) are \u0026ldquo;saying\u0026rdquo;.\nAI has already deciphered ancient languages that are no longer in use anymore, so the stretch to understand animals really isn\u0026rsquo;t as far as you might think.\n\u0026ldquo;There is something deeply comforting to think that AI language tools could do something so beautiful, going beyond completing our emails and putting ads in front of us, to knitting together all thinking species.

In the past year, two hundred and fifty thousand Guatemalan migrants have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. At least half of them are Mayans, and many speak little or no Spanish. According to the Department of Justice, Mam was the ninth most common language used in immigration courts last year, more common than French. Three Guatemalan Mayan languages made the top twenty-five: Mam, K’iche’, and Q’anjob’al.\u0026quot;\nThe need for translators in less common spoken languages is still extremely necessary and this article really demonstrates why.\nRead more here\n4.

We use AI to do transcription, translation and synthetic (AI) dubbing.\nWhen do we do this work for our clients? Generally when a client needs a managed service. This happens when a client is looking to try out tech and/or better understand the value proposition, or has their own reasons for us to provide this service.\nWhen this happens, the first task on our side is simple old transcription. That is what we are going to look at today - how do to a simple transcription.\nHow Long Does Transcription Generally Take? Google is our friend here. From the team at Opal Transcription Services, \u0026quot;The industry standard is four hours of transcription time for one hour of clear audio, or a 4:1 ratio – that is, one hour of transcription time for a 15-minute-long recording.\u0026quot;\n    Google Search: How Long Does Transcribing Take?    This is a pretty good way of thinking about it. Generally it will take about 4x the time of the video content.\nCan You Really Do Transcription At 3x Faster? Maybe. We think so, but there are caveats. This is how we did out testing. For this demonstration, we will use our standard Your Money: Peter Switzer video.\nYour Money was a short lived channel, but Peter Switzer has a very distinctive Australian accent, so we use this clip as a standardised test bed for a a number of different processes internally.\nThe below is how we tested our hunch.\nStep 1: Create a New Item And Upload The Video Step 1 is the same every time. Select the relevant template and upload the video.\n    3x Increase: Select the correct template and create a new item    Once the new item opens, upload the video - once uploaded it looks like below.\n    3x Increase: Upload your video using the highlighted button    Step 2: Use Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe to Transcribe Your Video     3x Increase: Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe to trigger the AI transcription    Click on Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe to use the AI to transcribe your content. We used Australian English here.\n    3x Increase: Action -\u0026gt; We selected Australian English here...    Depending on your file size, this can take time. The Your Money video is about 5 mb, and takes milliseconds. Basically, the bigger your video the longer it will take.\nStep 3: Clean Up The Transcription - Post Editing     3x Increase: Action -\u0026gt; We selected Australian English here...    This is where the majority of the work takes place. Here is what you need to do:\nScroll Down And The Video Will Pop Out (Picture-In-Picture) This is point 3 in the image above. The text in yellow is a projection, so you can change the colour (point 1) for ease of transcription.\nEdit Times And Text The editor works in real time (point 2), make changes as you go. Realistically, simply hit play and edit to your hearts content.\nDownload The SRT, Or Copy Paste The Content Depending on what you are doing, you will either (i) add open captions and download the video, (ii) download the SRT file, or (iii) access the captions directly.\nWe recently added the ability to directly access the captions without the time stamps - option (iii) above. Click the button highlighted in the below image to use this functionality.\n    3x Increase: Action -\u0026gt; Use the toggle to get the captions separately    Did We Get To A 3x Efficiency Gain? The above was not super scientific but we did get to the 3x gain. Effectively, the above means that the time it takes to transcribe the video is a little bit more than the video length itself.\nThis is due to stopping starting the PIP while you correct the captions. We found, for a 15 minute video, transcribing takes us about 20 minutes in total give or take. To be precise, 18 and a bit, but this is dependent on how good the original AI produced transcript is, which is in turn dependent on the kind of content in the video.\nAssuming 20 minutes though, given some video content will be faster and some will be slower, we get an improvement from 60 minutes -\u0026gt; 20 minutes, giving us the 3x improvement.\nConclusion Using the original 4:1 ratio, we think the average video of 15 minutes will take 20 minutes to transcribe, as opposed to 60 minutes for a fully human transcription. This is how we got to the 3x improvement.\nCurious about how we could help your business? Check out our managed service, or try our app for free!

Due to there being no Wikipedia Pidgin available, engineers Orevaoghene Ahia, 21 and Kelechi Ogueji, 23 had to train a Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) model to learn the language from scratch, \u0026ldquo;scraping 56,695 pidgin sentences and 32,925 unique words from a couple of websites.\u0026quot;\nWhilst the pair have done a lot and we mean a lot to increase awareness and the availability of pidgin English online, their hope is for their work to help Google \u0026ldquo;be more inclusive of the 75 million Nigerians who speak pidgin English.

We also look at work Comcast is doing to support hearing impaired clients. This is quite exciting from an operational perspective.\nLastly we look at a recent write up from the Latin Post which looks at how to interface with commercial translation firms for your localisation and internationalization requirements.\nA Once and Future Alphabet If you like language related content you should follow Tim Brookes. His work sits at the intersection of language and art.\nThis is from his recent kickstarter; disclaimer: we gave him a small amount of money because we are fans.\nBasically he works with artists to create woodcuts of content in relatively unknown languages.

Amazigh dialects are spoken by about 17 million in Morocco, 10 million in Algeria, 4 million in the Mali/Burkina Faso/Niger region, perhaps half a million in Libya, tens of thousands each in Tunisia, Mauritania, and Egypt, and several million scattered overseas, especially in France and Spain.\nUntil recently, this script was marginalised in favour of Latin/Arabic scripts, so writing a Tifinagh symbol on a wall, and may be interpreted as a political or generally subversive act.\nDue to work by the Institut Royal de la Culture Amazigh (IRCAM) in Rabat, Tifinagh is slowly coming back. This kind of news makes us happy.

Summers in Australia can be hazardous, but this year seems to be worse.\nFire bulletins go out but there were some concerns about Auslan support (the Australian version of ASL). One such example can be seen below. The link is here. Our take at VideoTranslator is that this was an oversight, and was corrected pretty quickly, so no harm no foul hopefully.\n    Source: Twitter; Retrieved Dec 13, 2019    But it would appear progress is being made more generally. The good people at Comcast and Connect Direct are taking the challenges of the hearing impaired community more seriously and have added ASL support to their customer service.\nQuoting, \u0026quot;For the first time in the cable industry, ASL will be a language option for customer service. The new feature will further bridge the digital divide for Americans with disabilities by ensuring that members of the deaf community can get connected to the Internet at home without barriers.\u0026quot;\nThe operational challenges of pulling this of are likely significant, so congratulations to Comcast for taking this step - we wish them best of luck with the continued delivery of this service.\nAccurate Translations and Localization Is Not Possible With Machines From the Latin Post, comes this headline.\nThe article makes the following points:\n Machines are programmed, humans program them. Humans come with cultural backgrounds, machines don\u0026rsquo;t. Humans understand humans, machines can\u0026rsquo;t. People get the intent, machines don\u0026rsquo;t. When in doubt, go for someone you can hold accountable.  Here at VideoTranslator, you might expect us to disagree with the above. We think the above points are actually quite reasonable, with caveats.\nFor every point above, we could furnish an example where the above either is, or is not, true. This might seem counter-intuitive, but this is complicated stuff, so it should not be surprising that there is truth to both points of view.\nThe way to think about AI is, use AI for the heavy lifting, and use humans for higher value tasks.\nUsing technology like our platform, human transcribers, translators and voice artists can greatly increase their efficiency. This does not mean it is a one-size-fits all.\nBut that is not really what this article is about. This article is about the pervasive belief that AI will replace human jobs.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t think this is true, or at least not the way most people think. It is true that AI is causing dislocations in several business models. It is also true that many of these business models were declining to begin with - AI can be thought of as the final straw rather than the reason for the failures.\nDoes this make a difference if you are likely to loose your job due to automation - hell no. however, it is a valid distinction to make when policy makers are looking for solutions.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers, but we do think our approach of using AI will be a net benefit to the transcription, translation and dubbing communities. This is because fundamentally, humans and computers are good at different things.\nWe should still have empathy for people at the margins who are getting their wages squeezed by the relentless march of technology.\nNot least because it will take humans to solve these, and other, challenges of the 21st century.\nConclusion We don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers, but we think it is possible to build platforms where the best of technology can help people be more effective and do more in less time.

Digital Health Trial Uses AI For Better Epilepsy Treatment Decisions     The possible drug combinations needed for Epilepsy patients are a lot of trial and error.    Clinical trials are underway in the US to better help specialists and patients when it comes to determining which drug scenario would be best for those who suffer from Epilepsy. Currently, there are over \u0026ldquo;14,000 different treatment scenarios\u0026rdquo; in which patients and doctors have in order to decide which medication would work best for each individual patient. As imagined, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of trial and error at the beginning of diagnosis. What the researchers at Stanford and doc.ai are aiming to do, is use AI to streamline the process so that it is more scientific and based on real life exposures.

Well, if you\u0026rsquo;re in NSW, you\u0026rsquo;re about to become a lot more aware and mindful when you\u0026rsquo;re doing it. In a world-first that commenced December 1 2019, the NSW Centre for Road Safety are using AI mobile phone detection cameras to spot drivers who are illegally (read: not using their phones handsfree) when driving. The system uses artificial intelligence to automatically review images and detect offending drivers, and to exclude images of non-offending drivers from further action. Images that the automated system considers likely to contain a driver illegally using a mobile phone are verified by authorised personnel. For the first three months drivers will receive a warning letter. Once the three month period is up, drivers will receive five demerit points and fines of $344 or $457 if in a school zone. In what is already a notoriously dangerous time of year on the roads, play it safe and stay off your phone when driving regardless of which state you\u0026rsquo;re in please.\nRead more here\n4.

I mean, all kinds! One of the specific bits of intel which is well worth tracking is Think With Google.\nToday we are going to look at a set of remarkable trend lines which point the way in which the world is heading.\nWe look at a 3 behaviour and cultural shifts inside YouTube.\n2 Behavioural And Cultural Shifts You should really read the article yourself, but the below was what we found super useful.\nSo the article has 3 big trends, but only 2 are listed below. We don\u0026rsquo;t really have anything to add to the third point.\nLocal Content Went Global     Source: Think with Google, YouTube Internal Data, U.S., March 2019–May 2019    Any way you look at this number, it is a remarkable number. When we consider how quickly this has all happened\u0026hellip; No seriously, its remarkable.\nWe are not surprised by this number - after all, our product is a video translator. Digging a bit deeper into the research Google has done, we get this image.\n    Source: Think with Google, Google Internal Search Data, Global, 2017 vs. 2018.    This quote is remarkable, \u0026quot;.. the U.S., we found people were often looking to reconnect with their heritage through their clothing. “I\u0026rsquo;ve become interested in my ancestry over the past four years and have started to include some Scandinavian styles in my wardrobe,” one American respondent told us — an insight relevant for more than just fashion marketers.\u0026quot;\nWe could not agree with this sentiment more. Culture is changing, and to be entirely honest, its a remarkable time to be alive.\nShopping Content Became Entertainment Ok - so we kind of disagree with this particular sentiment. Its a terribly well researched conclusion but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure this is exactly what is happening. From the research, we get the below infographic.\n    Source: Think with Google, Pew Research, 2016.    But does it mean what we think it means? Not sure we entirely agree.\nHere at Video Translator we think people connect to content other people care about. It is a fundamentally human thing to do.\nIf you make a video where you clearly care about the topic, other people are likely to also care. In a happy coincidence almost anything, when looked at closely, is fascinating.\nThis deep rooted human interest in \u0026lsquo;stuff\u0026rsquo; other humans find to be of value, we think is the mega trend. Well, its the mega trend also known as civilization.\nThe point is not to disagree that some merger between shopping an entertainment has happened, its to note that this is part of a bigger, richer, human story and should really be treated as such!\nConclusion Do you also track the research Google puts out? Even if not in digital marketing, they put our absolutely remarkable stories.\nLet us know what digital marketing stories caught your interest?\nCurious about how we could help your business?

It picked up a negative profile last month by none other than the New York Times.\nEven worse was that Rev managed to become the poster child of gig-economy companies who mistreat workers. This led to a lot of negative media coverage which is probably not what Rev is looking to do.\nWhat Set Off Media Focus This article by the NYT set of this series of events.\n    Changes: Not the kind of media coverage you are hoping for...    \u0026ldquo;Until last week, Li Zilles was one of the many nameless and faceless contractors toiling in the bowels of the internet, providing online services that might have been mistaken for the work of artificial intelligence.\nThe job: to transcribe audio files for the start-up Rev.com, churning out texts without clients ever knowing the name of the transcriber.\nThis was a lonely existence, and not an easy one. The pay, even though the work was full-time, was little enough that food stamps became necessary.\u0026quot;\nUgly... then things got worse\u0026hellip;\n    Changes: Things get worse... that is 5.7k retweets and a lot of likes!    What Did Rev Do? Slator, an industry portal, covered the issue quite well. Quoting, \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; Rev offers a platform where Revvers (what freelancers on Rev.com are called) can work on transcription, video captioning, foreign subtitles and, to a much smaller extent, translation. A Revver takes a job by going on the platform, checking out the job specs, and claiming the job if they wish, or returning the job to the queue if not.\nRev found itself in the center of a maelstrom when, on November 8, 2019, it lowered job-pricing rates for freelancers hired through its platform. Revvers took to social media, complaining that the announcement of lower rates was poorly handled; that is, through an internal Rev.com forum that Revvers say they hardly ever check.\u0026quot;\nRevvers And Clients Get Involved. Gizmodo Jumps In\u0026hellip; Rev clients started to weigh in, and this unfortunately made Rev look worse.\n    Changes: In response to the media firestorm clients started to weigh in    Gizmodo picked up the issue. Quoting, \u0026ldquo;Rev, one of biggest names in transcription—and one of the cheapest services of its kind—opted to alter its pay structure with little warning for thousands of contractors on its platform, some of whom are furious at what they expect will be smaller paychecks from here on out. \u0026ldquo;\n    Changes: Gizmodo\u0026#39;s take on the issue    OneZero, an online publication got in on the act, but looking at a different point of view.\n    Changes: OneZero starts looking at other issues that Rev is currently having    Then Rev\u0026rsquo;s competition started to jump on the bandwagon.\n    Changes: Rev\u0026#39;s competition gets involved    You may be interested in the full text - its a pretty interesting read and makes valid points. Importantly, it goes over numbers which are pretty revealing.\nThe good bit, \u0026ldquo;Rev previously paid $0.45 per audio minute, so a typical worker would earn the equivalent of $6.75 per hour. At its new rate of $0.30 per audio minute, that same worker doing the same work would earn only $4.50 per hour.\u0026quot;\nI don't want a 1/3 pay cut, and I'm assuming you don't either!\nSo What Does It All Mean.. We don't really want to comment on the specific issues Rev has been having. Clearly, some things went wrong and there appear to have been a few technology failures as well.\nThis kind of thing can happen to any technology company, gig economy powerhouse or otherwise. We at VideoTranslator do not have the details of what happened inside Rev, and the drivers of their decision making - with luck Rev's staff is able to navigate this challenge in a way which works for Revvers and the client base.\nWhat we really care about is - this event set is based on a number of structural issues.\nWe think there are two structural issues these events revealed, and below is the thinking at VideoTranslator on how to handle these issues.\nStructural Issue 1: Are We Talking About Freelancers, Contractors Or Workers? The NYTimes articles starts with, \u0026ldquo;gig-economy company whose workers\u0026rdquo;. While several parties are involved here, the implication is pretty clear.\nIrrespective of what gig-economy companies might say/do, there are sections of the public who think that the contractors or freelancers (whatever your preferred nomenclature is) are workers.\nThis can be disputed, of course, but the structural issue for technology companies is that pressure can be expected around this challenge.\nYour product may not be affected directly, but your people and clients clearly are, so chances are your product is going to have to evolve to meet this challenge.\nRealistically, chances are its going to be an ugly learning process for any company caught up in these issues.\nStructural Issue 2: Is AI Reducing Take Home Pay For Workers? Maybe yes, maybe no. This specific instance did not directly involve AI, but Rev\u0026rsquo;s management is probably feeling pressure from AI based competition.\nIs this an instance of AI reducing take home pay? Probably not directly, but the likelihood is AI probably accelerated any pre-existent pressures.\nI think AI is not particularly responsible for causing these pricing pressures per se, but is making the competitive landscape more exciting, which is causing business models to break down in a number of instances.\nAI firms need to understand the broader pressures in the economy, if for no other reason than it directly affects our competitive landscape. Pretending this is not happening unfortunately does not make it go away.\nStructural Issue 3: How To Create Solutions Where AI Complements Humans? In theory, computers are good at things humans are terrible at (math, doing repetitive tasks) while humans are good at things computers are terrible at (judgements calls, adapting to a rapidly changing environment). This is the good news.\nIn practise, this is really hard. There are some really positive views on how machines can help people - for example here. Also lots of examples of how this interaction works out negatively.\nOur approach is to build a platforms that treat people as in integral part of the process. Use AI for the heavy lifting, and people for higher value tasks.\nConclusion We don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers, but we think it is possible to build platforms where the best of technology can help people be more effective and do more in less time.\nTalk to us to find out more!\nCurious about how we could help your business?

Today we are going to take the same idea forward, and now going to translate the video into Hindi.\nTo recap, we used a sample clip from Rajya Sabha TV which as (a) transcribed using a speech-to-text AI, and (b) cleaned up by a human. We will now clean it up a little bit more, and then translate the content into Hindi. Finally, we will use a Text-To-Speech AI to speak out the Hindi content.\nIts going to be awesome. We hope this post gives you some ideas about how to use our technology. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin!\nWhat Are We Going To Be Working With? Our Source Video Is Already Transcribed We will use the video we produced at the end of this post. It is posted below.\n  Transcribing Indian English: Outcome after using the AI\n   First though, a bit of theory! Just like school!\nThe Look-Ahead And Forward Algorithms - The Theory One of the challenges in working with AI is the Look-Ahead and Forward algorithm usage. The majority of translation AI\u0026rsquo;s use the look forward algorithm to translate text content.\nFrom our trusty source of all knowledge (Wikipedia), Look-Ahead (backtracking) is 'In backtracking algorithms, look ahead is the generic term for a sub-procedure that attempts to foresee the effects of choosing a branching variable to evaluate one of its values. The two main aims of look-ahead are to choose a variable to evaluate next and the order of values to assign to it.'\nAlso, and slightly more technically, a Forward Algorithm is 'The forward algorithm, in the context of a hidden Markov model (HMM), is used to calculate a 'belief state': the probability of a state at a certain time, given the history of evidence. The process is also known as filtering. The forward algorithm is closely related to, but distinct from, the Viterbi algorithm.'\nThe Look-Ahead And Forward Algorithms - What Do I Need To Know? Okay - what does the above mean? Basically, the translation AI looks for a full stop. Once it finds the full stop, it translates the sentence.\nNo really - what? You need to add grammar, primarily full stops and comma\u0026rsquo;s so that the text-to-text translation AI works properly\nTo do this, make sure you check your transcript for grammatical correctness. This is shown below. Practically this means:\n  Add lots of full stops everywhere! Humans are very good at understanding each other, so we don\u0026rsquo;t need to be told where one sentence ends and where another sentence starts. AI\u0026rsquo;s - not so much.\n  If you watch the video embedded below, the sentences have all been converted into shorter sentences which are in third person. An AI can translate the shorter sentences way better, but take care to not loose meaning.\n  It is expected that a human subject matter expert translator will do post editing after the AI has done its first pass. However, simplifying means that you can translate into many languages quickly, and the post-editing can be reduced. Use your judgement!\n  The grammar was changed - shown below. If you watch through the video below, you will notice the open captions do not match what is being said. Note that this step is being taken primarily in preparation for the translation step.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Add lots of grammar      After the process was complete we add an Auto-Overlay so you can see the full outcome. Note that the words are a little bit different, tense had been changed to past tense for everything and sentences are shorter.\n  What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Amend the English and add an Auto-Overlay\n     Very cool. Now we can begin the translation process. Nicely done!\n  Translating The Content To Hindi   So the first thing we need to do is translate the content. Click Action -\u0026gt; Translate and translate this video into Hindi.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Translate your video      It\u0026rsquo;ll take a few seconds and then you will see the translated file in your Root pane. It is hightlighted in yellow in the below image.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Translation is complete!      Open it up, and in the Captions tab you will be able to see the translation. In the below image, note that the colour of the text has been set to black so it is easier to see for your post-editing.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Hindi captions can be edited as necessary      When you do your own video, please ensure you do post editing! Remember, use the AI for the heavy lifting, but use human subject matter experts for the best results.\n  Below, we use the Auto-Overlay so you can see the output. We are using a black text with a yellow highlight at transparency of 80%. The little spinner indicates that the app is applying the Auto-Overlay to the video asset. This is what creates the open captions in the video.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: The spinner shows the app adding an Auto-Overlay      This is a direct AI translation so some errors are expected. Also, note that the timings are a little bit off. What is happening in the background is our code is trying to do a best fit of the sentences, but manual edits are often required. Please do this as part of the post-editing process.\n  What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: After adding the Hindi captions\n     Well done! Your video is now translated. But you thought it was going to speak Hindi?\n  AI Dubbing In Hindi - Now The Magic Starts! This is the simple version - we can get much more sophisticated in our outcome, including voices that sound like young or older people, men or women, and changing the volume and speed of the speech.\nIt is also possible to break the conversation up into different blocks of speech, properly matching the English content spoken.\nDrop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai if you are curious and have questions. Or try the free-trial!\n  Copy the captions from the Video component into the Audio component.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Copy the captions into the Audio component      Now we will use a Text-To-Speech AI to 'speak-out' the content in Hindi. Use the Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe to access the Text-To-Speech AI as shown below. This will give us the AI dubbing.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Use the Text-To-Speech AI for AI dubbing      Abracadabra!\n   Next Steps - How To Implement Your Own AI Dubbing There are many options you have once you AI dubbing is complete. Several clients simply prefer to download the asset and work on it in their preferred audio/video editor. However, much of the same functionality is also present in the app.\n  Mute the original audio soundtrack using the \u0026lsquo;minus\u0026rsquo; button as shown below.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Remove the original audio stream from your video      Generally it is recommended you slow-down the AI dubbing. This is because it is an AI, there is limited scope for tone. People expect changes is tone when talking to each other. An AI is unable to do this so when there is less tone, it helps to slow down the speech to about 90%. This helps people to understand the words.\n  When you insert the AI speech into the video as an Audio-Overlay use the 'plus' button to add the AI dubbing *.mp3 file.\n    What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: Remove the original audio stream from your video      Above, the highlights show (a) the plus button at the bottom to add additional audio overlays, (b) the original soundtrack muted and new soundtrack added, (c) the new soundtrack has its speed reduced to 80%, and (d) start and end time can be managed on a per conversation block basis.\n  The final outcome is below. This has several errors, and needs more work. To see the error forward to 1:57 and you will hear the sound stops. This is because we have just used one mp3 Voice Overlay for simplicity to explain the workflow.\n  What A Hindi Speaking AI Sounds Like: After adding a female Hindi speaker\n     Congratulations! We hope you found this post useful. This is quite a simplified workflow - let us know if you have any questions.\n  How To Think About This   Generally, you would break up the transcript into multiple conversation blocks. This helps space out the AI speaking nicely.\n  Select the appropriate gender of the AI if there is a conversation happening between a man and a woman.\n  If two men or two women are speaking in a conversation, use multiple AI voices. This helps your viewers understand what is happening.\n  Remember, the key win is SEO. When deploying the asset to some social media channel like LinkedIn or YouTube, make sure to translate the relevant metadata. This helps search engines index your content making it reachable in other languages.\n  Conclusion Please connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nCurious about how we could help your business?

Thanks to a new development in AI technology, that will begin to change. We\u0026rsquo;re also looking at how educators in the US are frantically searching for a better solution to interpretations services that help communicate with non-English speaking families and we look at the leaps and bounds being made in medicine thanks to machine learning.\n1. Using artificial intelligence to analyze placentas     Using AI to determine the health of placenta and baby    Research is under way to aid pathologists in better understanding placental development and how it can benefit both mother and baby during pregnancy. Artificial intelligence will study both sides of the placenta in order to determine the placenta\u0026rsquo;s health and any risks associated to the pregnancy. The end goal being that the technology will aid many women during and after their pregnancies, especially in areas of lower income; these places tend to have less resources and hence more complications during pregnancy and childbirth.\nRead more here\n2. Education Department’s phone translation system clogged with long waits, dropped calls: teachers Educators in the US are struggling with a lack of translation technology and lacklustre interpretation services when it comes to parent/teacher interviews with non-English speaking families. After the US Education Department switched interpretation service vendors earlier this year, educators are dealing with extremely long wait times, calls constantly being dropped and often times no pick ups at all. Teachers are having to rely on fellow bilingual staff to interpret important information to families about their students.\nRead more here\n3. Machine learning has revealed exactly how much of a Shakespeare play was written by someone else     Shakespeare didn\u0026#39;t always work alone    It\u0026rsquo;s been a mystery that has been plaguing literary analysts since 1850, but thanks to AI technology, we now know that Shakespeare wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a one man show. It has been discovered that fellow playwright of the time, John Fletcher contributed to passages to Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s Henry VIII. AI studied both men\u0026rsquo;s works and writing characteristics and analysed how much of each was prevalent in the play. As it turns out, it is believed that Fletcher co-wrote about 50% of Henry VIII.\nRead more here\n4. Paging Dr. Robot: Artificial intelligence moves into care Stress and ill mental health unfortunately often go hand in hand with university students and so the University of Southern California has developed AI programs for students to talk to during trying times. Using an AI and virtual reality character Ellie and AI-based program, Ask Ari, students are able to talk to both Ellie and Ari, that will in turn give them information about when to talk to a counsellor and vital resources to improve their mental wellbeing. The aim is to not replace therapists, but rather work with them to determine \u0026ldquo;who is most likely to be suffering.\u0026quot;\nRead more here.\n5. Lung cancer: AI shows who will benefit from immunotherapy     AI is helping to determine the benefits of immunotherapy on lung cancer patients    The fight to cure cancer is stronger than ever, and again doctors and scientists are looking to AI programs to help determine which lung cancer patients would benefit from immunotherapy. A relatively new form of treatment, \u0026ldquo;immunotherapy works by boosting a person\u0026rsquo;s immune response against cancer tumours.\u0026quot; The AI model, being developed by a team led by researchers in Case Western University, will help doctors determine, which patients are responding to the immunotherapy, resulting in higher survival rates as well as lessening unnecessary costs.\nRead more here\nConclusion Please connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/the-weekly-roundup-26-nov-2019/","tags":["English"],"title":"Hello baby!

And advances in health and medicine thanks to AI."},{"categories":["Best Practices","Video Translator","Accessibility"],"contents":"DISCLAIMER: This blog post was updated after having a conversation with JobsForNSW. [3 Dec 2019]\nPlease check the JobsForNSW website for updates. The process covered below changes regularly and DO NOT rely on the below to be correct going forward. It was correct at time of publication, but talking to the JobsForNSW staff it is LIKELY to change pretty soon.\nEarlier this year we put in an application for a Minimum Viable Product Grant from JobsForNSW, a NSW Government initiative.\nIn this blog post we are going to look at the entire process and work through our successful application. Specifically:\n What is the MVP grant and where do you get more information? What the grant process looks like and what information we had to provide to get the grant. What the grant process was like, step by step, at a procedural level.  The point of this post is to provide information to anyone else within the Sydney/NSW startup ecosystem who is also looking into this grant and potentially applying.\nWill probably do another post of the content of (a) the videotranslator.ai grant application itself, and (b) the progress report at the end.\nWe are also hoping to have a follow up post where we talk to one of the officers inside JobsForNSW to get a insider view into how the process works.\nWhat Is The JobsForNSW MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Grant? From the JobsForNSW website, Minimum Viable Product (MVP) grants are designed to support promising startups with the funds needed to progress from a proof of concept stage to a minimum viable product. The grants are aimed at startups that are yet to generate revenue to help them engage with a potential business customer, or channel to market, and create innovative solutions that address compelling industry needs or market gaps.\nHow Much Money Can I Get From The JobsForNSW MVP Grant? From the JobsForNSW website, An MVP grant is a matched funding grant up to 50% of approved project costs, to a maximum of $25,000.\nRemember: You do not have to ask for the full $25,000.\nIn the specific case of videotranslator.ai we had a total project cost of $41,400.00. The idea is JobsForNSW is funding 50% of approved project costs, to a maximum of $25,000. Hence the amount we ended up getting for our project was $41,400 * 0.5 = $20,700.\nAssuming We Get The Grant - What Is The Timeline For The Application Process? From the JobsForNSW website, Successful grant applicants will receive 35% of the funding up-front and 65% after completion and validation of the MVP.\nThe exact sequence of events is provided below:\nDISCLAIMER: SmartyGrants below is the old system - JobsForNSW are transitioning to a new system.\n  You put in your application using an online system called SmartyGrants. The form itself is fairly straightforward - we did not use any external consultants.\n  You get a notification saying your submission has been received. This is an email and looks like below. Note the blacked out telephone numbers and emails are public, but have been hidden to the JobsForNSW staff don\u0026rsquo;t get spammed. If you really need to reach them, get creative with Google.\n    Winning: Submission Acknowledgement from JobsForNSW      You get another notification saying you have been moved to round 1 of the selection process. Unless your application is terrible and you have not completed the form, you should get to here without too many issues. It looks like below:\n    Winning: Round 1 Acknowledgement from JobsForNSW      Once here JobsForNSW has an internal process. In another post we will talk about how that exactly works. For now, the application goes to an internal committee and either you get the grant or you don\u0026rsquo;t get the grant.\n  In our specific case, videotranslator.ai got the grant - Winning! Also, on winning the grant you get notified by email. This looks like below:\n    Winning: We Won!      You will also get another email, from a person - that how you know :)\n    Winning: The JobsForNSW team is working on your funding deed      Download the deed, and make sure you sign and return the contract.\n    Winning: Get your pen out and sign the contract!      Sweet - the entire process took maybe 8 weeks - its a pretty quick turnaround.\n  Assuming We Get The Grant - What Do I Need To Know About The Deed? The grant is fairly simple. That being said, there are a few things which are really important:\n  The grant will cover the budget you put into your application. You really want to get this part right!\n    Winning: Make sure your budget reflects what the project is about!      Additionally, it is important that 80% of the Project Costs are within NSW. This does not mean if you pay Google Cloud or AWS or Azure you are in breach, it means that you can use a maximum of 20% of your budget on offshore resources. You also need to be aware that the duration of the projects is a maximum of 6 months.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about being too specific - in private conversations, the JobsForNSW staff understand you are a startup and maybe not everything works out. They understand that you are trying to do something really hard, and not everything goes to plan always.\n    Not Winning? If things go wrong with your project, talk to your advisor. Its ok, JobsForNSW understands that things go wrong sometimes      Lastly, the deed will cover exactly what JobsForNSW will fund and its timing. This looks like so:\n    Winning: Payment terms for your MVP grant      You're good to go!\n  Assuming We Get The Grant - What Is The Timeline For The Project? The main points to know:\n  The payment is in two parts. The first 35% is pretty much immediate. You raise and invoice and that is it.\n  The second part happens at the end of the project. You submit a report (using the same online application), have a meeting with your advisor, and then raise another invoice for the remaining 65% of the grant monies.. You get an email about this too:\n    Winning: Progress report accepted      In the app, at the end of the process (I\u0026rsquo;m writing this post after we have finished) the payments will look like below.\n    Winning: Three submissions in total after winning the grant, (a) 35% invoice, (b) Progress Report on completion, and (c) 65% invoice      That is kind of it in terms of process.\n  Conclusion We are super grateful to JobsForNSW. We did complete out prototype, filling out bits that did not work very well. We picked up a client (hopefully they will become a keystone client) during the project, and the client is super happy with our work.\nPersonally, we have not yet reached product-market fit, which I think of as having a scaleable sales process for your product at a good customer acquisition number (CAC), rather than product itself, but also think we are well on our way :) :)\nThank You I spoke to some other folks at Fishburners for advice through the process and after. Would like to thank the folks below, you guys are awesome.\n David Cox at QAChef. Man LEE at Sana. Peter Boyer at Muster - a mate at Fishburners was curious about the MVP process.

Before, During And After..."},{"categories":["Transcription","Video","Subtitles","Captions","Languages","Visual Guides","Accessibility"],"contents":"Working with a prospect, we added a number of enhancements to our open captions workflow. If you are interested in what open captions are and what its use cases are please have a look at this blog post.\nVery simply open captions are generally used as an accessibility tool focused on people who have hearing impairments. More recently due to the rise of streaming services, open captions have been making a come back.\n  As an example, a simple use case would be a new mum at home with her child. If the child is sleeping, the mum can watch video content (on TV or online) with open captions on mute.\n  Another example is people watching video on a social media platform, where the video content is often auto-played but in a muted environment.\n  We have added one simple enhancement to the Auto-Overlay functionality. The new functionality allows a user to add the open captions anywhere in the video.\nWe will be using the same RSTV sample which we worked with in an earlier blog post. To see how we used an AI to caption the Indian English video, please read this blog post.\nContext + The Enhancement A client we have been working with for a while had the following requirement. He wanted to add the open captions in a specific place in the video. Historically this was possible but was very hard to use effectively.\nThe enhancement is that we now allow X and Y coordinates to be placed, allowing the user to have fine grained control over the placement of the overlay.\nWhat Used To Be Possible? Assuming you followed the steps in this visual guide, you would be aware we can add open captions using the Auto-Overlay feature.\nBasically we used the Auto-Overlay feature as shown below. This is a two step process - we already have the captions from the previous steps.\n  Use Action -\u0026gt; Auto Overlay and choose a text colour, size and font. We have chosen black colour text, with font size 36 and font Ubuntu.\n    Open Captions: Step 1 in the Auto Overlay      In the second step, it used to only be possible to choose from three options Top, Centre and Bottom. This is shown below.\n    Open Captions: Step 2 in the Auto Overlay      It is important to understand what is happening here. Its basically a mathematical function called a text writer that is writing-out (or baking-in) the open captions into the video. The yellow highlight was probably not the best choice but its useful in demo.\n  Open Captions: After the Auto Overlay process has finished\n     Ok - now we are going to make some changes. First we use Action -\u0026gt; Remove Auto-Overlay to take away the open captions as we want to move them around. This looks like the below image.\n    Open Captions: Remove the Auto Overlay      How Has Auto-Overlay Changed? The change is slightly different for (a) the stripe, and (b) the highlight in the Auto-Overlay function. First, lets talk about the stripe and then we will look at the highlight.\nUse the Action -\u0026gt; Auto-Overlay and we use the pre-filled values for Step 1. The below images are from the point-of-view of Step 2.\nNo Stripe Or Highlight In this use case we don\u0026rsquo;t want a stripe or a highlight. This is shown in the image below.\n    Open Captions: No Stripe or Highlight    Depending on the colour scheme of the underlying asset the lack of a stripe or highlight may not offer the best user experience.\nUsing A Stripe In this case we want a stripe. The idea of the stripe is a bar across the screen. Here there are two options, show the stripe always, or show it only where there is text on the screen.\nFirst of course, go ahead and remove the no-stripe/no-highlight overlay from your asset. Then, trigger the Auto-Overlay process again.\nText Only Vs No Text Only Why would you use this? The use case is to do with the speed of the speech in your video.\n In the case where the speech is very quick, with minimal breaks in the speaking, we would recommend No Text Only Alternately, if there are gaps in the speech, use Text Only.  The idea is when the underlying speech is relativity fast the flickering of the stripe looks terrible, so you want the stripe to be in place irrespective of whether the text is showing or not showing.\nThe below example is of a Stripe with Text Only and we are using the blue colour.\n    Open Captions: Stripe with Text Only    This does not look amazing but you can see the effect of the Stripe with Text Only.\n  Open Captions: Stripe with Text Only\n   Using A Highlight In this case we want to use a highlight. The idea here is a highlight around the text in question. Using the highlight option looks like below. Text only is not a thing with the highlight for obvious reasons.\n    Open Captions: Highlight    In the video below, we used the Centre option to make it very obvious what is happening. Transparency is also turned down for the highlight itself.\n  Open Captions: Highlight but centred with no transparency\n   The Big Change: Advanced Options - Stripe The stripe example is the slightly more complicated of the two options. The first thing to note is the actual dimensions of your video. In our case, the video is 640 x 360 pixels. This is shown in the image below.\n    Open Captions: Work out the dimensions of your video    Add a stripe with the below advanced settings. Note that these numbers are actually wrong, but very useful to understand what is happening.\n    Open Captions: Add X and Y coordinates    What we are doing here is setting X and Y coordinates for the text at 20, 20. We are also setting the X and Y for the stripe at 40, 40. Normally you would set the stripe to X and Y coordinates similar to the text.\n  Open Captions: Stripe with incorrect advanced options\n   Ok - so that was nice, but not really useful. Lets try again with the below settings.\n    Open Captions: Add different X and Y coordinates    This looks much better. The idea here is to put the stripe at the bottom of the video. But we have made a mistake in the alignment of the text.\n  Open Captions: Stripe with less incorrect advanced options\n   With the examples above, hopefully it makes sense how to use this functionality.\nImportant: If you are using the stripe, please note that the height of the stripe is 10% of the height of the video itself. You may need to manually fix up the captions so that all the captions are single lines only.\nThe Big Change: Advanced Options - Highlight Highlights are easier to use than the Stripe - mostly because we only require one set of X and Y coordinates. The setup used is shown below.\n    Open Captions: Add X and Y coordinates - just one set for the text    This results in the following video using the highlight. Please note this setup is not optimised and make the changes required on your side.\n  Open Captions: Highlight is much easier to use!\n   Important: If you are using the highlight, it is well worth making sure that each sentence is roughly the same length and centring the open captions into the video nicely.\nConclusion We hope that this visual guide is helpful to you! Open Captions are very useful, and a critical part of the value proposition our video translator offers to clients.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/open-captions-enhancements-november-2019/","tags":["English"],"title":"Open Captions: Enhancements November 2019"},{"categories":["Video Translator","Enterprise","Weekly Roundup"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s another AI focused week and with so much going on in the world of Artificial Intelligence, can you blame us? The field of medicine and science have long been advocates of using AI for the greater good and it appears there are some incredible trail blazers helping to make that happen.\n1. A Star Professor—And Her Radical, AI-Powered Plan To Discover New Drugs     Using AI to discover new medicine    One woman is using her incredible skills and mind to advance the way in which drugs can be discovered and created with the help of artificial intelligence.

For the sake of safety: This AI sensor triggers an alarm when kids are left alone in a car Too many times we hear the heartbreaking stories of children and animals dying after getting left in cars on hot summer days. Luckily scientists at the University of Waterloo, Canada have developed a low-cost AI sensor that may very well save lives. The small device will be able to detect movement from breathing and will sound an alarm (and potentially disable the ability to lock the car), if it detects a living being is still in a vehicle.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;It addresses a serious, world-wide problem. The system is so affordable it could become standard equipment in all vehicles,\u0026rdquo; George Shaker, an engineering professor at Waterloo said in a statement.\u0026rdquo;\nHoping to be on the market by the end of next year, we look forward to this advancement in technology.\nRead more here\n3. Farmers are using AI to spot pests and catch diseases — and many believe it’s the future of agriculture     AI enhanced drones are able to detect disease in crops    Drones equipped with AI computer vision are beginning to gain traction world wide in the agriculture industry. On a farm in Argentina, the drones are able to \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo; at each and every single wheat stalk and identify the start of disease that could threaten the crop for that year.

Artificial intelligence: the fall of the Mad Men and the rise of the machines This article delves into why it is better to be on the side of new technology rather than fight against it and how those in the marketing field can and should be making the most of the new era we find ourselves in. Interestingly describing artificial intelligence as \u0026lsquo;enhanced intelligence\u0026rsquo;, author Graham Hayday demonstrates how new technology is actually a friend instead of a foe in the marketing industry and how creatives are using AI to enhance their abilities.

Burton/Getty Images    We really couldn\u0026rsquo;t have summed up this article better ourselves, so we\u0026rsquo;ll let authors Sema Sgaier and Francesca Dominici do it for us:\n\u0026ldquo;Health care leaders are embracing AI. But by conducting an extensive review of case studies and research literature, we’ve found that their AI initiatives are predominantly focused on developing algorithms that can predict a problem such as cancer in order to make diagnoses better, faster, and less expensively. Rarely, are their organizations devoting resources to AI efforts aimed at understanding why diseases occur. To intervene as effectively as possible, both kinds of algorithms are crucial.\u0026rdquo;\nThe article goes in depth of explaining what is being done to use AI at discovering the causes of disease as well as just predicting them.\nRead more here\nConclusion This week has shown great developments in technology, especially in the AI field where we are seeing just how beneficial AI technology is becoming for us around the world.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nIf you haven’t yet and are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform, or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/the-weekly-roundup-12-nov-2019/","tags":["English"],"title":"Using machine learning for the greater good; advances in medicine, agriculture and saving lives, is there anything we can't do with the help of artificial intelligence?"},{"categories":["Transcription","Video","Subtitles","Captions","Languages","Visual Guides","Accessibility"],"contents":"Today we are going to look at how to transcribe Indian English. Firstly of course, what is Indian English, and what does it sound like? How many such dialects exist? Have a look.\nNow that we know what Indian English sounds like, we are going to use a short clip from Rajya Sabha TV, an Indian government content creator. We use our AI to transcribe this clip.\nLastly, we add an Auto-Overlay so that we can show you the video. The final output is shown below.\n  Transcribing Indian English: Outcome after using the AI\n   What Is Indian English? From the folks at Wikipedia, \u0026ldquo;Indian English is the regional variety of the English language spoken in the Republic of India, and among the Indian diaspora elsewhere in the world. The Constitution of India has mandated Hindi in the Devanagari script to be the official language of the Indian union; English is an additional official language for government work along with Hindi.\u0026rdquo;\nCool. What does it sound like?\n  Rajya Sabha TV: 5 November 2019\n   Are you keen on hearing what other dialects of English sound like? Here are some samples.\nHow Do I Transcribe Indian English? Follow the below to transcribe your content in Indian English.\n  Click on the English Template and add an new Item. We've called it rstv1 in the image.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Use the English Template to create a new Item      Upload your video. We\u0026rsquo;ve made some changes to the upload screen which you can see below.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Add your video to the video component in item \u0026#39;rstv1\u0026#39;      Use Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe and a modal similar to below should show up. In the below image we have used Indian English - essentially telling the Artificial Intelligence that our video should be transcribed the the Indian English specific AI.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Tell the AI to use Indian English      The item will close and a little spinner will appear. Once complete the item with un-gray and we go in and look at our transcript. The captions button gets highlighted. Woohoo! This is the half way mark - now we have to clean up the transcript a little bit.\n  How Accurate Is The AI Transcribed Video? How Do I Make Changes If I Need To Edit The Transcript? We always recommend you have a subject matter expert check the AI's work - this process is called post-editing.\n  Scroll down so you see the captions - the video will pop out as a picture-in-picture for easier editing.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Picture-In-Picture pop out      To start with click on the text colour box and change it so you get a decent contrast - we picked blue. The idea is to change the colour to make it easier to work with - note this is just to make your life easier!\n    Transcribing Indian English: Change the colour of the text      Now go through and make any changes you need! Remember you can change both the times and text to match your use case. We made a number of changes - mostly fixing time/words and adding grammar. Below, you can see we go from 2 -5. This makes no difference, and will be auto-fixed on save.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Make any changes you need too!      Add In Open Captions Using the Auto-Overlay Functionality Now that we have our captions sorted out we add in Open Captions. Open Captions are recommended from both (a) accessibility considerations, and (b) increasing traction on social media.\n  Use the Action -\u0026gt; Auto-Overlay to add font Montserrat yellow text with size 30. This looks like below.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Add black colour text, size 30 with font Montserrat      We are also going to add a blue highlight.\n    Transcribing Indian English: Add a yellow highlight      All done - what do you think? Download the asset and deploy!\n  Transcribing Indian English: All done!\n     Conclusion Edit: We originally use the yellow test/blue highlight in the last section. This looked terrible on top of the pastel colouring of the video. So it was changed to black text/yellow highlight.\nIn another blog post we will translate the content into Hindi.

We want no boundaries, no borders on this at all. It\u0026rsquo;s all ‘we and us,’ and we\u0026rsquo;re all planting trees, which is awesome.” For every dollar donated to the Arbor Day Foundation, one tree will be planted.

The financial benefits of being bilingual One study has to lead to research that suggests that by being bilingual you are more likely to be less emotionally invested in your financial transactions. Conducted by Mustafa Karatas of Koç University in Turkey, the study had bilingual participants decided on the amount they\u0026rsquo;d sell an item for. When they were deciding on the amount in their native language, the price at which they would sell the item was significantly higher compared to those who were selling in their non-native language. It appears the psychological phenomenon known as the endowment effect (where a person who has an emotional investment in an item values it at a higher cost than a potential buyer), does not effect a person when they not interacting in their native language.

Walking through time: how AI is rebuilding centuries-old Europe     Forget the DeLorean, AI is making time travel possible    Europe is renowned for its diverse, centuries-long history and culture and now AI is helping us to travel back in time to experience the European days of old. Experts including computer scientists and historians have gathered in Dresden, Germany to discuss how best to use AI to document Europes expansive history. Virtual worlds is at the top of their list. AI will have the arduous task of transcribing documents that will in turn show us just how Europeans lived in the past. Virtual worlds built upon this data, will allow us to experience how cities and towns looked in various years over time.\nRead more here\n2. Australian court interpreters working with domestic violence survivors call for more support Interpreters are vital in domestic violence cases for non-English speakers in Australia and yet there is a lack of resources in the legal system. Interpreter for the legal sector, Liana Papoutsis says that the lack of interpreters for domestic violence cases can be somewhat attributed to the impact the cases have on the interpreters. \u0026ldquo;Interpreters have been traumatised by family violence details, and\u0026hellip;many will avoid family violence matters, whether it is for a family violence intervention order, or breaches, which move the matter from the civil to the criminal,\u0026rdquo; she said. She is urging for services to be put in place to ensure that interpreters get the support they need during and after difficult cases. This will hopefully, in turn encourage interpreters to take on domestic violence cases, where they are very much needed.\nRead more here\n3.

Doctors could team up with AI to spot dangerous brain bleeds faster     Easier and quicker detection in brain injuries and trauma could be potentially lifesaving    Brain bleeds, head injuries and strokes can be particularly hard to detect and diagnose, which can lead to life-altering or ending circumstances. A team at the University of California, San Francisco are developing AI software that will assist doctors in determining the diagnoses of such cases. The software, called PatchFCN is able to \u0026ldquo;interpret CT scans of heads\u0026rdquo;, which at times can be somewhat more difficult for doctors who are trying to find a tiny area in the brain from just a scanned image.

Is AI accurate when it comes to Transcription? Is AI accurate when it comes to Translation? If I use AI for Text-To-Speech Dubbing, will it sound natural?  Lets look at these ideas one at a time.\nIs The Artificial Intelligence Accurate? When Is Artificial Intelligence Not Accurate? Answer: It depends.\nLets talk about where Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning came from - both of these technologies were originally known as Big Compute and/or Big Data. While referring to the field in this form is no longer useful, its super useful to think about the field in these terms.\nUsing vast amounts of computing power on large databases set the stage for the advent of AI. The way to think about AI is pattern discovery at scale (@petertboyer). The pattern discovery and/or matching is essentially statistics and this is what data scientists spend their time doing.\nFailure in AI - that is, when the AI gets stuff wrong - can be due to a number of issues. The simplest kind of error to diagnose is probably the over-fitting problem, where the statistical model behind the AI is tweaked so much, there is no room for small deviations.\nThe more general mode of AI failure is the AI does not have a large enough data set to be trained properly. The reason we refer to this as a more general failure mode, is if the event we are trying to pick up has not happened before, there is little chance the AI will pick it up.\nThere are several other failure modes for AI, but we will be looking at the more general failure mode as described above.\nIs AI Accurate When It Comes To Transcription? Answer: It depends, pro-tip: pretty much all the answers here are going to be some variant of it depends :)\nUntil fairly recently, dialects were less studied by linguists. This is because the tools to truly understand dialects did not exist.\nLargely, this has changed due to Google and the other big technology players. Now, due to low costs of data storage, we are able to store and analyse large amounts of audio/video content.\nWithin the Video Translator application, we have a one-to-many language-to-dialect mapping.\nIn the case of Spanish for example, we have a number of dialects. Using the correct dialect is vital for AI accuracy. Similarly, we have a large number of English dialects too - our latest is English (Singapore).\n    AI Transcription, Translation And Dubbing: Several Spanish dialects are available.    Use the correct AI for the correct speaker. What if your content has multiple speakers? Right now, read this to understand how to compensate - but it is absolutely a problem we are working on and think some very exciting things are possible in the future.\nIs AI Accurate When It Comes To Translation? Answer: It can be very accurate. Lets be clear - AI when used for translation is normally a bit meh. Here is how we recommend you play it.\n  Assuming you did a AI transcription first, that is - you used an AI to do a Speech-To-Text conversion, you need to clean up the grammar. This process is known as post-editing.\n  Humans are smart, so in a conversation, we know when a comma, or full-stop, would be appropriate. In addition, a large amount (possibly even a majority) of communication is not related to words. It can come from tone, hand gestures or even facial gestures.\n  All of this communication is not visible to an AI. Hence, fix up the grammar and check your transcription.\n  Remember: Use the AI for the heavy lifting, and use your own Human translators for the high value tasks of cleaning up the AI\u0026rsquo;s work. Practically, this means thinking deeply about the intended audience, and what concepts they are familar with, and plugging that gap.\nIf I Use The AI For Text-To-Speech Dubbing, Will It Sound Natural? Answer: Yes - but this depends on what you are trying to achieve. Two examples might be useful here:\n  For our healthcare clients, the use case is often the video is aimed at possible low literacy/exposure stakeholders. Practically this means we may take some AI generated dubbed speech, and slow it down up to 85% of the original. Note, this is specifically because we are trying to reach people who may not be literate.\n  For elderly clients, we sometimes change the dialect. For example, an elderly man of Indian descent may speak English perfectly, but has trouble understanding Australian English (or vice versa). In this case we might slow the AI down 5%, but it is the changing of dialect which becomes magic. For a visual guide read this.\n  Remember: Think deeply about your target audience. There is no such thing as translation quality, there is only - did my target audience understand? It is perfectly valid to loose information content, if context is preserved. Indeed, people are very good at working out what someone else is saying, as long as both are on the same page.\nConclusion In this blog post we looked at some of the different ways in which AI Accruacy can be thought of - while we do not have all the answers, we hope the above is useful for you.\nThe way to think of Video Translator - strategy and discretion across your translation life cycle.

If you are wondering, is my content suitable for AI dubbing, or AI localisation? In simple terms:\n What is dubbing or dub localisation? Should I use a human, or a machine for my dubbing? How do I use a video translator to dub my video? Rules of thumb, or heuristics, to achieve a superior outcome with AI dubbing?  On reviewing this visual guide, you will be able to (1) upload your own video content, (2) transcribe your content, (3) dub your content into a different dialect.\nNote: We are going to take a video in Australian English, and switch it into American English. Obviously, the usual use case is to translate into some other language first, and then do the dubbing. We forego the translation so this guide is easier to understand.\nBasics From Wikipedia, \u0026lsquo;Dubbing, mixing, or re-recording is a post-production process used in film making and video production in which additional or supplementary recordings are \u0026ldquo;mixed\u0026rdquo; with original production sound to create the finished soundtrack.\u0026rsquo;\nIn everyday usage however, the term 'dubbing' commonly refers to the replacement of the actor's voices with those of different performers speaking another language, which is called 're-voicing', or a 'voice-over' in the film industry.\nOutcomes - Before And After To make it obvious what we are talking about, the after is provided.\n  AI Dubbing: After Adding the AI voice-over\n   Steps - Transcribe Your Content Using The Provided AI   We are working with an English video today, so select the English template, and create a new item. Note that the account we are using to show this functionality has Chinese, French and Vietnamese as translation options. We will not be using this functionality today.\n    AI Dubbing: Select the English Template and create and new Item      This is the original content.\n  AI Dubbing: Before Adding the AI voice-over\n     We know the speaker is an Australian so we select English (Australia) as the preferred dialect to transcribe with - note picking the correct dialect makes AI accuracy much better.\n    AI Dubbing: Use Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe and then select Australian English      Once transcription is complete, use the Picture-In-Picture to clean up the transcript. Note that the text shown in the PIP is real time, so you can edit both timestamps/text of the transcript and see the changes directly.\n  You can see we removed text fragment 9 and merged it into text fragment 8 as an example. This makes no difference to the rendering of the captions. Use the Auto-Index button to fix this up if you require your *.srt to work properly.\n    AI Dubbing: Use the Picture-In-Picture to clean up the transcript      Save your changes and your transcription is complete. If you need the captions burnt into the asset, use the Auto-Overlay. Nicely done!\n  Steps - Dubbing/Adding A Voice Over With AI   To dub the content using a different voice, our first step is to copy the captions from our video component into our audio component. Click into your editor, and hit Ctrl-A and Ctrl-C.\n    AI Dubbing: Select the captions and copy using Ctrl-A and Ctrl-C      Go to the Audio component, click add captions and paste your content. Use the highlighted button to add captions without adding an audio file.\n    AI Dubbing: Go to an Audio component, and paste your captions there using Ctrl-V      We will transcribe again this time using the Text-To-Speech Transcription AI. In the below image, we use the Text-To-Speech tab. It is also possible to break up your captions into fragments, as shown below. We will only use the first fragment, but you can break your content to produce different *.mp3 files.\n    AI Dubbing: Use the Speech-To-Text AI to speak out your content      A few quick notes. The options shown are the different voices, with (M) for Male and (F) for Female. The accent can also be seen and we are using English (US) (M) which is American English Male. The S/P indicates Standard, or Professional - we recommend Professional, Standard is simply an older technology (sounds more robotic). Once done, it looks like below.\n    AI Dubbing: Audio component after text-to-speech transcription      The audio content is below. Have a listen! Sweet - dubbing is complete.\n   Steps - Overlaying Our Audio On Our Video   We are now going to add our generated audio to our original video. Go back to your video component, and click on Audio Overlays. Click the + and your audio fragment will be shown.\n    AI Dubbing: Add the AI speech using Audio Overlay      Notice, we have not set any times. Add (in seconds) the time. We added 0.5 and 21 as start and end times, and then clicked the + button to bake in the audio overlay. That is the entire process. The final output is shown below.\n  AI Dubbing: After Adding the AI voice-over\n     Conclusion In this visual guide, we used our video translator to dub, or overlay a different voice, on our video.

With over 10.9 million people visiting it each year, it\u0026rsquo;s obviously one of Australia\u0026rsquo;s hottest tourist spots.\nWhen searching online, the official videos for the Opera House are all in English, which is great for English speakers, but what about those who aren\u0026rsquo;t?\nUsing the videotranslator.ai app and creating translated videos would be a great way to reach millions of people worldwide who aren\u0026rsquo;t native English speakers. It\u0026rsquo;s quick, easy and extremely cost effective.\nRead on as we show you how to translate this video on the Sydney Opera House from English to French in 8 simple steps.\nSteps: How To Transcribe And Translate A Video From English To French   First off, we\u0026rsquo;ve logged into our videotranslator.ai account and have selected our template. Once selected we then add a new item and name it, in this case we\u0026rsquo;ll name it SydneyOperaHouse.\n    A French Affair: Add a new item \u0026#39;SydneyOperaHouse\u0026#39;      Next we upload our video. Once the upload is complete we select the video and tell the app what English dialect is being originally used in the video. The speakers are from Australia so we select Australian English.\n    A French Affair: Select to transcribe using Australian English      The app then transcribes the video and the transcription will be shown on the screen. Because people don\u0026rsquo;t always speak the way they write, the AI can sometimes miss capitalisation, commas and full stops as well as misuse certain words.\n  Due to this we need to check the transcription ourselves and make any corrections. This in turn helps the written content make sense to the AI when it begins translating. This process is known as post-editing and is super important for quality control.\n    A French Affair: Post-Editing is used to control quality      We then embed the English captions into the video which will produce the below video.\n  A French Affair: Translating your video from English to French\n     Once we\u0026rsquo;ve got the English captions embedded it\u0026rsquo;s time to translate them to French.\n    A French Affair: Translate to French With AI      We select Translate from the Action menu and then select \u0026lsquo;Automatic\u0026rsquo; for the AI translation as well as setting the language to French.\n    A French Affair: Translate to French With AI      Just as before, we want to check the AI translation and make any corrections as needed. Once all is good, we embed the French captions into the video and voila! Our video on the Sydney Opera House can now be viewed in French.\n  A French Affair: Translating your video from English to French\n     Conclusion: We Transcribed And Translated An English Video To French In this post, we have converted a video from the Sydney Opera House from English to French. We did this by, first transcribing the video in English, then translating the captions into French, and finally embedding the caption content into the video.\nIf you were to post such translated content online, it is recommended to also translate the title, description and other metadata into the target script, in this case French. This will improve your French SEO, allowing native French speakers to find your content online.\nVideo Translator makes no representation of a relationship with Sydney Opera House.

In other words, using video content in social media marketing is a very good strategy. In this post we look at some numbers, and try to work out what this means for content creators and marketers.\nRenderforest put together an insightful report on social video marketing. Here are some of their statistics:\n 100 million hours of video per day is watched on Facebook. Video posts are shared 1200% more often than text and image posts, combined. 16% of YouTube videos are embedded, linked, or shared. 82% of Twitter users watch videos on Twitter. 45% of all Internet users watch at least 1 hour of video content per week. 4.6 billion video ads are watched online each year.  Are you seeing the value of video marketing on social media?\nBest Facebook Post Format For Engagement BuzzSumo spent a lot of time looking at video on Facebook, the below image is sourced from their 2019 Ultimate Guide to Facebook engagement, and you can clearly see the value of video.\n    BuzzSumo: Best Facebook Post Format    How To Optimise Your Videos For Social Media Before you post your video, there are a few things you should know about video on social media. There are certain traits that a video post must have before it can perform well on social media.\nTip 1: Your Video Should Make Sense On Mute 85% percent of Facebook users watch video on mute. What this tells us is that people who use Facebook are reluctant to want other people to know! They could be using it as a distraction during a dull meeting or class, or maybe they just want to be polite.\nThere is also a strong argument to be made for accessibility as part of your strategy, and the fact that many users like to watch video while multi-tasking, making open captions a requirement.\nWhatever the reason, videos that are easily understood without sound cater best to Facebook’s user base. You should consider embedding open/closed captions into your video.\nTip 2: Aim For Between 180 And 200 Seconds, Or 10+ Minutes Statistics show that for Facebook, videos between 180 and 200 seconds, or about as long as a song on the radio, have the best engagement on social media. Longer than 200 seconds, engagement tends to drop off. This may be a testament to how long people can keep interest, or how much time they want to spend on social media in general.\nThis story is a little different in YouTube-land. The folks at TubeFilter took a fascinating look at what was happening in YouTube, and the below graphic comes from them. Their conclusion, longer equals better for YouTube, with 10+ minutes video\u0026rsquo;s achieving the best life time views.\n    TubeFilter: Life To Date (LTD) Average Views verses aggregated Average View Duration    Tip 3: When Should You Post Your Video Answer: it depends on your audience. No, really, it depends on your audience.\nEvening Posting Works Best On Facebook A study found that posts made between 7pm and 11pm get the most engagement on Facebook. This varies somewhat depending on your audience’s demographic.\nFor example, users in nonprofit industries have some hot spots for engagement earlier in the day⁠—but in general, posting in the evening as opposed to during the morning and afternoon commute tends to fare best.\nTake a look at your Facebook Audience Insights to see where your followers live, and choose convenient times for them to see your posts.\nPosting Around Lunchtime Works Best For Instagram Instagram has been found to have the most engagement between 10am and 3pm on weekdays, with very low engagement on Sundays specifically.\nWe follow the people behind Sprout Social, as they really know what is going on - the below graphic is from their best times for social media post.\n    Sprout Social: Best Times To Post On Social Media - Instagram    Post In The Morning For Twitter The most engagement on Twitter happens at 9am. It greatly drops after 4pm, so plan on posting during the daytime.\nOn LinkedIn, Post On Wednesday Mornings The most engagement on LinkedIn happens between 9am and 11am, as well as 12pm (think lunch time). on Tuesdays through Fridays. The platform has very low engagement on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays.\nConclusion Posting video on social media on social media has a great return on investment because of how much engagement video posts get. That said, video posts need to have certain traits to perform well. Video posts should be understood with the sound turned off, not longer than about three and a half minutes, and shared at strategic times of day.\nTo summarise, pay attention to who your audience is and where they live, as well as which social media platform you’re posting on. In other words, to get the most engagement, avoid posting on all of your social platforms at the same time.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform, or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/why-post-video-to-social-media-3-tips/","tags":["English"],"title":"Why Post Video To Social Media: 3 Tips"},{"categories":["Video Translation","Transcription","Accessibility"],"contents":"We have been working really hard making a number of changes to our underlying application.

The post got re-tweeted 70K+ times, and liked 74K+ times. That is clearly something which struck a cord. Why?\nWho is using subtitles or captions, why are they using it, and how can you also use subtitles or captions. For a technical discussion on subtitles or captions, see this. This post is more about the value in subtitles or captions.\n    Subtitling For The Win: @deafgirly    We totally liked the Tweet!\nContext There are two kinds of captions, open captions and closed captions.\n Open Captions are the type of captions which are permanently embedded into the video asset. It is not possible to remove these captions. Closed Captions are generally a separate file from the primary media asset, often in *.srt format. Depending on your video player, it should be possible to switch these on and off.  Open captions are not very popular. We think this is because they are mostly ugly (the old SRT format is from the video cassette recorder days). Open captions are also quite hard to use, in that SRT captions cannot handle much by way of styling, changes in text direction, bold/italic etc.\nClosed captions are popular because it is possible to load up multiple language files. Still, the styling remains less than ideal, and it only works where the player has the capacity for Closed Captioning.\nOpen Captions Make A Comeback Form the article, the reason for the big response is it allows people to consume video content while multi-tasking. Additionally, quoting from the article, an Ofcom study from 2006 estimated that of the 7.5 million UK TV viewers using subtitles, only 1.5 million had a hearing impairment.\nWe think another big reason is the rise of audio-muted auto play social media channels. From Facebook to LinkedIn, people are increasingly consuming video content without the sound turned on, which is a big market.\nOpen Captions are totally making a comeback.\nHow To Add Captions or Subtitles To Your Content The process differs depending on the language(s) you are choosing to work with - assuming your content is in English.\n  Upload your asset into the video translator application. Then select Action -\u0026gt; Transcribe, assuming you do not have any captions.\n    Subtitling For The Win: Trigger Transcription AI      Pick the correct dialect. If you are using another language, pick the correct dialect for the content you have. Trigger the speech to text transcription AI.\n    Subtitling For The Win: Choose Your Dialect!      The Outcome Post Addition Of Open Captions   Once your subtitles or captions are good (you should check!) use Auto-Overlay to programmatically add captions. We used the ever popular yellow text with a blue highlight to get the below effect.\n    Subtitling For The Win: Add Open Captions!      That\u0026rsquo;s it - now go add subtitles on all your social media, and watch your engagement sky-rocket!\nDeafinitely Girly approves, “It would be great if they were mandatory across all streaming services and at least 50% of cinema showings.”\nNotes On Usage The main challenge around Open Captions is you can only embed (or bake, burn, write etc) one set of open captions into an asset. What if your user wants a different language?\nWe think of this as the chicken-egg problem. Effectively, unless your target audience can find your asset, this will never be an issue. The smart way to manage this is to translate your title, description and other social media specific metadata to the language your open captions are in - this way you are optimising for search.\nConclusion Technology is offering us ways to look at old problems with new eyes. We should look at open captions as a tool - something good for accessibility, and for booting your bottom line.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please try our platform, or drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/subtitling-for-the-win/","tags":["English"],"title":"Subtitling For The Win"},{"categories":["Video Translator","Enterprise","Transcription","Translation"],"contents":"This post is not really about diversity. It is about the granular challenges around governance in an increasingly complex world, and operational solutions which may work going forward.\nWe look at three events which took place in this week. What the problem is, and what a solution might be. These events are:\n Trump Administration’s Deregulation Drive Begins to Impact Language Industry Sometimes Lost In Translation, With Dialects Context Is Key Translating verdicts will help all litigants  Trump Administration’s Deregulation Drive Begins to Impact Language Industry US federal regulations have generally favored the language services industry. In part, due to accessibility regulation, there is legislation which requires government entities to provide services in many different languages.\nFrom the July 3, 2019 article, a judge commenting on the changes said, \u0026ldquo;What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate? You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?\u0026quot;\nThe counter comment to this was provided by a Justice Department official saying the shift was due to, \u0026ldquo;part of an effort to be good stewards of (the department’s) limited resources\u0026rdquo;.\nRealistically, these are both really good points. What are you going to do?\nSometimes Lost In Translation, With Dialects Context Is Key In far away Bangkok, deputy leader of the Future Forward Party (FFP), Kunthida Rungruengkiat, was criticised after she put forward a proposal to allow lawmakers to speak in their regional dialects in the chamber.\n    The Growing Pains Of Diversity: Kunthida Rungruengkiat    Here is the interesting part, \u0026ldquo;Proponents lauded her call for preserving cultural and linguistic diversity, while at the same time, critics said her proposal was unrealistic and out of context\u0026rdquo;.\nThen there was more excitement, the House Speaker Chuan Leekpai, opted for the middle ground. \u0026ldquo;Northern, Isan, Southern and Central Thai dialects are beautiful in their own ways,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;However, I plead with members to use the Central form, or dialects that are comprehensible to everyone, as otherwise the sessions will be difficult to understand.\u0026quot;\nThe key take away here is, much like the above, these are both really good viewpoints. Honestly, what are you going to do?\nTranslating verdicts will help all litigants Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of India took notice of the challenge, and \u0026ldquo;announced that all its judgements will be translated to six regional languages and will be uploaded on the court’s website by the end of July\u0026rdquo;\nFrom the article, there are three main upsides to here:\n Increase awareness of laws specific to folks from rural on backward (read: low literacy) areas of India. Will benefit litigants from rural areas, \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; many litigants come from rural areas. If the service and information are given to them in their language, they will feel more comfortable and satisfied. It is better than hearing it from someone else\u0026rdquo;. Will benefit lawyers who do not necessarily practice in English, \u0026ldquo;Only a few lawyers study or practice in metropolitan cities, where English is taught from the primary levels. Many aspiring lawyers study or practise in other districts where English isn’t the primary language and this move will help them.\u0026quot;  But why are they not arguing like the above two cases?\nThis is the main takeaway, \u0026ldquo;Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi has given his nod for a translation software developed by an ‘in-house’ electronic software wing.\u0026quot;\nThey have a solution. This is why there is no argument.\nThe growing pains of diversity. What are you going to do about it? Our viewpoint on this is simple. We could get into arguments about which viewpoint is correct, but this is not so useful.\nThe basic points are:\n We want to offer people access to services in the language they are most familiar with - mostly because it leads to better outcomes when stakeholders understand what is going on. Its really expensive to offer people access to services in their own languages - mostly because operationally, this is hard.  A possible solution We have AI. Lets use it. We can translate audio, video, images, and text. However, this has been around for a while, but is not really used - why?\nOur product is specifically designed to translate nested data structures. If you are translating a video, you also want to translate the title, description and other metadata specific to the social channel you are delivering content to - the point of the entire exercise is for multi-lingual SEO/SEM\nThe problem is a chicken-egg problem. If stakeholders cannot find the answers they are looking for in their own language, the enormous expense of translation does not translate (possibly a terrible pun) into ROI.\nWhat are you going to do about it?

The original name did not really work, and was always a temporary name.\nThis post covers some of the context of where our platform came from, and what changes happened in the course of getting this app to market, including a pivot.\nWe used SEO to determine a new name. Read on to understand why this was done, how it was done, and what benefits we expect to get from the name change.\nWe See The Need For A Product - Late 2016/Early 2017 Our SaaS application started as a simple idea late in 2016. The original idea was to use AI to translate websites.\n It is easiest to come up with an idea by having a requirement. In a previous life, one of our founders had a requirement of translating collateral into a number of European languages. Due to the nature of legal requirements, the cost of translating a single piece of collateral (think 2-4 page corporate brochure\u0026rsquo;s) is high.  This requirement can be converted into a small problem/solution description. Effectively:\n A client has a current website, and our value proposition was creating a micro-site. That is, a simple landing page which has been modified to have really good multi lingual SEO. The value proposition was that a client using our technology would have the ability to service inquiries in a number of languages, and jump to the top of the organic search results.  Actually having a requirement - that is, you are actually the person who needs the product - is step one in coming up with the product.\nIt is of course, possible to come up with a completely new product without yourself needing this product. This is harder to do.\nWe Have No Traction - August 2018 There are several definitions of traction. Largely, when we say \u0026lsquo;We Have No Traction\u0026rsquo; we mean things were not working. Clients were not coming in the door, it was hard to get meetings, and we were definitely not getting paid.\nThe long and short is while we had a working prototype, which clients could use, the sales process was very painful. Every conversation would end in, \u0026lsquo;love the idea, talk to me in 3 months when I have budget\u0026rsquo;.\nThis was less than ideal, but after unpacking the statement, the major issues were:\n There was no way to demonstrate the value upfront to the prospect. That is, if a client does create a landing page in a different language, what will happen - is the client guaranteed additional traction? There was no easy way to allow the client a simple first step - as the value proposition was a few web-pages in another language, there was no easy way to try without impacting the entire client website. The change management process was painful, and even we we offered to do all the work, the client would still need to offer their own resources (that is, a change management team) to even try the offering.  Traction is the lifeblood of any startup, but way more importantly, little/no early traction is telling you something very valuable. When something works easily, this is tell you what to focus on, or in this case what not focus on!\nTraction, we weren\u0026rsquo;t getting any. Really. It was time to pivot.\nWe Need To Pivot - January 2019 We needed to focus on a few things, and we had learnt a few lessons.\n As a startup, you are unlikely to get traction with enterprise without godfathers. This is not good or bad, simply it is what it is. We needed a way simpler value proposition. Its not about having an elevator pitch. Its about being able to answer your \u0026lsquo;what-is-it\u0026rsquo; in a few words. Due to time/runway limitations, we need a very simple initial target audience, which is made up of B2C or B2B where the prospect is as small as you are.  We rebuilt our value proposition based on the simplest, cheapest client we knew we could acquire.\nThe pivot was to leave behind the multi-lingual website, and pivot to simply video translation. Translating video is, in workflow terms, exactly the same as translating a website. It is however, much simpler to do technically and way simpler to sell. The key point is a refocus to find a simpler, tighter, value proposition.\nWe Need A Name - May 2019 The original name, QBL Media, was a working title which had originally been sourced from a popular computer game.\n There was a feeling, from the start, that as the product found its feet, as the functionality was fleshed out, an appropriate name would be found. The idea is, as the value proposition came into being, an obvious name for the product would suggest itself. Once the focus became just video translation, post our pivot and total lack of any traction, this gave us a lead in terms of what needed to happen.  Once our value proposition became obvious, we knew what needed to happen to work out our new name.\nUsing SEO To Generate A New Name - July 2019 One simple trick\u0026hellip; no really. Once we knew what our value proposition was, we used a lot of keyword analysis and playing with various search engines to work out our new name. In the end,\n The simplest use case we had was Video Speech-To-Text. That is, people who wanted the transcripts for video content. Many people do not know that this is known as transcription, this is known as video translation, as in \u0026lsquo;I want to take this video and translate it to get the subtitles\u0026rsquo;. We spent a bunch of time looking at the keywords suggestions on our Google Ads account.  Once we knew the simplest use case of our value proposition, everything was tailored to come up with a name that described how people were looking for that value proposition. This is how to use SEO to come up with a new name\nPeople spend a lot of time looking for how to translate video.\n Sometimes this means getting a transcript of a video. Sometimes this means translating a video they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand. Sometimes this means how to translate a video into some other language.  This is our \u0026lsquo;what-is-it\u0026rsquo; moment!\nOur end result was simply turning video translation into a verb, and calling our new platform videotranslator.ai, and in terms of our app, app.videotranslator.ai.\nConclusion Our new platform was named by doing research on our simplest value proposition. What search terms to people use to find answers related to our simplest value proposition?\nMore importantly - don\u0026rsquo;t waste time coming up with a cool new name. As your product or service takes shape, as it becomes a thing, a name will turn up. Seriously.

The majority of these can add captions, or add subtitles, to your video. However, to do this we first need a transcript of the audio or video content.\nGiven the number of video transcription services out there, which one should you choose?\nBefore you take on the monotonous task of transcribing audio to text, read this blog post to see the major differences between two transcription platforms, rev.com and videotranslator.ai and what you can expect when selecting a transcription service.\nWhat’s the difference between VideoTranslator.ai and Rev.com? Why choose VideoTranslator.ai verses Rev.com? VideoTranslator.ai VideoTranslator.ai is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application which allows you to use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to speed up your transcription process.\nIn layman’s terms, this means we use Speech-To-Text AI\u0026rsquo;s to do the busy work of transcribing our audio or video content into text for us.\nWhat you can expect from this is a much faster turnaround time (minutes rather than hours) so you can add open captions to your content very quickly. Additionally, we can transcribe many languages, allowing you to use your valuable staff time for higher value tasks.\nRev.com If you currently use a transcription service, or are evaluating transcription services, you may have heard of Rev.com. Rev.com is a service that uses a mix of human and machine transcription to provide transcription capabilities.\nAs such, the turnaround time tends to be a bit longer, and you may be paying considerably more for the service depending on the length of your video.\nIf you’re looking for a high degree of accuracy, and don’t have the option to post edit the copy in-house, then Rev.com might be the type of service you need.\nThe Difference Between Human Transcribers And Machine Transcribers The difference to all this is that an AI’s tend to be poor writers. Since people speak much differently than they write, AI’s often miss punctuation and grammar nuances that aren\u0026rsquo;t articulated in spoken language.\nSo if you use an AI, you will need someone to edit the copy of the audio or video content. This process is known as post-editing.\nDespite the time taken in post-editing, it is still much faster than transcribing the video manually, as the AI does the bulk of the work with timing and writing out the words.\nWhat If I Need A Translator?

Generally, this is the first question a prospect asks us about our platform. In practise, they mean a few different things.\n We want subtitles for our audio/video content. We have subtitles, but want to make changes to the timing. We want to embed our subtitles into our video file, for use in Social Media.  Let us look at these questions in detail.\nWhat Are Subtitles or Closed Captions? Subtitles are text derived from either a transcript or screenplay of the dialogue or commentary in films, television programs, video games, and the like, usually displayed at the bottom of the screen.\nOne of a series of subtitles, accessible through a decoder, is known as a \u0026lsquo;closed caption\u0026rsquo;. The term \u0026lsquo;closed\u0026rsquo; is because the captions are not visible until activated by the viewer. On the other hand, \u0026lsquo;open\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;burned-in\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;hard-coded\u0026rsquo; captions are visible to all viewers.\nWhat Subtitle File Formats Exist? The most common subtitle/closed caption file format used is *.srt. An SRT file (otherwise known as a SubRip Subtitle file) is a plain-text file that contains critical information regarding subtitles, including the start and end timecodes of your text to ensure your subtitles match your audio, and the sequential number of subtitles.\nThere are a large number of subtitles or closed captions formats available, see here and here for details.\nSample Subtitle File We use the video translator to produce a subtitles file. The following image is what a subtitle file, a *.srt looks like, click here to download the sample SRT file.\n    Example of an SRT file    How Do I Make My Own Subtitles?  (Manual) Using a notepad tool, such as Notepad++, Sublime Text or your own computers default text editor, you can create your own SRT files. (Automatic) Use a video translator to transcribe your content using a Speech-To-Text AI which (a) automatically works out your captions, and (b) create the SRT file.  Remember: If you are using the AI, please check/edit the transcript after usage. Both text and timestamps can be edited in the platform.\n    Use a Speech-To-Text AI to automatically create a SRT file    How Can I Add Subtitles To A Video File? How Can I Add Subtitles To A Video File For Free? If you are looking to do an \u0026lsquo;open caption\u0026rsquo;, or embed/burn the captions into your asset, use the Auto-Overlay function in your video translator.\n  Once you have the captions, click on the Action button and select the Auto-Overlay.\n    Action -\u0026gt; Auto-Overlay      Select the asset. Then choose a font, font-size and font-colour. In the below, we use Noto Sans, 30 and a strong blue. Click Next.\n    Auto-Overlay -\u0026gt; Font, Font-Size and Colour      In the below, we choose a Highlight, and a yellow for the colour of the highlight. Click Confirm.\n    Auto-Overlay -\u0026gt; Highlight      The final asset with the Auto-Overlay. Change the styling on your own video to make it look nice!\n  Video Translator: Pricing: Subscription vs. Pay-As-You-Go\n     Conclusion Making subtitles is straightforward. First, get the transcript of your video. Second, make the SRT file, and once this is ready (a) embed the SRT into your asset, or (b) manually upload the SRT into the social media service you are using.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-do-i-make-subtitles-and-closed-captions/","tags":["English"],"title":"How Do I Make Subtitles And Closed Captions?"},{"categories":["Engineering","Video Translation","Support","Patch Notes","Accessibility"],"contents":"We have been putting in for a number of grant applications in the innovation space.

Fixes include (a) and upload bug, (b) a naming convention enhancement, (c) a UI timing bug, (d) UI help bug, and (e) UI folder bug.\nMay 2019: Upload Bug Previously, if you uploaded certain files, and exceeded certain file sizes, the application would error without notifying the user.\nSpecifically, on the operational side, we setup all client with file and size permissions at enrolment. In the below, *.bmp was removed from the image list, and *.mov was added to the video list.\n Generic: *.pdf only, maximum 100mb. Image Files: *.png, *.gif, *.jpg, and *.jepg only, maximum 100mb.

This has now been addressed with the bottom-centred snack-bar and message.\n    Patch Notes May 2019: Upload Bug    May 2019: Naming Convention Enhancement Previously, on uploading assets, the asset would be rename to include a unique identification code which would be reflected in the name. This has been improved upon, and now the asset names should not include special characters, and are mostly transparent to users.\n    Patch Notes May 2019: Before Naming Convention Enhancement        Patch Notes May 2019: After Naming Convention Enhancement    The only difference is the extra characters at the start of the asset have been removed.\nMay 2019: Timing Bug Previously, there used to be a bug where changing the times within the *.srt files would cause the application to crash.

We will use a podcast as our sample audio content, and assume you are on a free trial. This post covers:\n Sign into the application. Create an audio specific template. Create a new item, with our audio specific template as parent. Upload our podcast, and then use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transcribe our content.  On reviewing this visual guide, you will be able to upload your own audio content, and transcribe using an AI.\nA quick summary of the process below is, to start with we create a new template audioTemplate which we setup specifically for podcasts as a once off. Then, we will use this to create an audio item, myFirstPodcast of type audioTemplate, for transcription.\nSteps - Create An Audio Template   Please open your browser and go to videotranslator.ai, and then click on the Login button. Assuming you just registered for the free trial, the below is what you should see when you sign into the application.\n    Audio To Text: Register for the Free Trial, then Login      Normally, we could just use myTemplate. However, as this is a visual guide, we will make a new template, and do this the long winded way. Click on the New Template button, and use audioTemplate for the name as shown in the below image and Submit.\n    Audio To Text: New Template \u0026#39;audioTemplate\u0026#39;      This is a new template, and we are going to add an Audio component. Click the Add Fields button, then select Audio, as shown below.\n    Audio To Text: Add an audio component (field)      Once added, expand the audio component using the highlighted + button. The other highlight is what the audio component will look like once we create a new item.\n    Audio To Text: Audio component expanded      Use the action bar to Publish the template. This makes the template usable to create new items. We have also changed the Information to be Please upload the podcast?, this change is purely cosmetic.\n    Audio To Text: Publish \u0026#39;audioTemplate\u0026#39;      Exit the template editor. Your Root will now look like the below image. The green is a visual indicator indicating that this template was just created. You have successfully created your \u0026lsquo;audioTemplate\u0026rsquo;.\n    Audio To Text: \u0026#39;audioTemplate\u0026#39; is now ready      Why am I doing this? The template editor provides you the flexibility to tailor your template to your specific use case. Specifically, in addition to the \u0026lsquo;audio component\u0026rsquo; we added into our template, you could add:\n Image Fields: Assuming you were uploading your content into a third party audio sharing service, you can add a poster or banner image, which should boost engagement. Text Fields: Assuming you were uploading your content into a third party audio sharing service, you can add a title, description and other metadata as additional text fields. Uploading these increases SEO substantially, and this effect is magnified if we were to also translate the audio content.  Should I do this every time? No - absolutely not. The entire idea of a template is to create a data structure which meets your specific use case and reuse it every time.\nSteps - Create An Audio Item, and Transcribe   Click audioTemplate, and then click Add New Item to create an item of type audioTemplate as shown below.\n    Audio To Text: Create \u0026#39;myFirstPodcast\u0026#39;      Today, we will use a podcast from the Creative Commons team, known as Plays Well With Others. We are big fans of the work Creative Commons does, and you should check them out if you are not familiar with the contribution of CC to modern open source software.\n  Upload the *.mp3, and you should see something like the below image.\n    Audio To Text: Upload your podcast      Now, trigger the transcription. We used American English in this case. Accept to start the process. The item will exit, and lock itself until the AI completes the transcription process.\n    Audio To Text: Transcribe your podcast      You are done! Click on the Captions to see the results of the AI. We recommend checking/editing to make sure the AI has transcribed your podcast properly. Remember, check grammar and capitalisation. In the below, 'plays well with others' is not capitalised. The AI did not pick this up, because it was spoken normally, not especially pronounced.

This includes marketers for exporters, tourism concerns, media shops and everyday folks looking to build brands and businesses using tools like YouTube and LinkedIn.\nJust for some background, we are a tiny software company, and think of ourselves as basically an independent studio, trying to craft the best tools we can. How tiny? Two and half men tiny. No, literally.\nIf you give our platform a shot, and think it is useful, do let us know. Most of this work was made possible by us digging deep, behind which was mostly normal folk being super engaged with our ideas and giving us heaps of encouragement.\nVideo Translator\u0026rsquo;s translation platform (\u0026ldquo;the application\u0026rdquo;) is an Internet-enabled SaaS (Software as a Service) platform which assists content creators (\u0026ldquo;the client\u0026rdquo;) to engage with stakeholders (\u0026ldquo;the audience\u0026rdquo;) from different linguistic backgrounds. The application is used to convert hypermedia content from one language to another, using an Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nLaunch We are super excited that we finally have our platform out there. The platform does only one thing really, and that is it uses AI in a sequence, to translate audio and video content. Effectively:\n Upload your audio/video content. Use a Speech-To-Text AI to transcribe the content. Use a Text-To-Text AI to translate the content. Use a Text-To-Speech AI to speak the content out in the target language.  Each of these AI\u0026rsquo;s can be used independently, or in a chain. The thinking behind this is optionality (the quality or state in which choice or discretion is allowed).\nWe do not know exactly what sequence each of these steps should be used in, for any specific use case. We want users to have the choice in how this could work.\n Do you want to use the Speech-To-Text AI only, just in English because your content is destined for a LinkedIn profile? Do you want to use the Text-To-Text AI only, because you have stakeholders who are trying to do a survey in several languages [the use case for multi lingual forms]? Maybe you are a social enterprise, looking to raise awareness in a rural area where people are not very educated or computer literate?

It sounds hard to believe, but this is honestly the case at the moment. The controversy revolves around a secret video, which the current Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison has (apparently) recorded.\nThe gist of the news is that the Australian Prime Minister has recorded a video, which will be translated into a number of languages. Once translated, the video will be broadcast in the media in different countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iraq. Obviously this is a concerning message, but it can well be argued we live in concerning times.\nWhat we would like to do in today's post is show that sometimes, the stories are not all bad. Specifically, in this case we took a video from BorderTV, which is run by the Department of Home Affairs.\nToday we will do the following:\n We will use the Speech-To-Text AI Transcription to transcribe the video. In this case, the subject of the video Aliir Mayom Aliir is a professional football player (Australian Football League) who was born in South Sudan in a refugee camp. Once the transcription is complete, we will use the results and manually fix up the transcription. Following this, we will use the second AI to translate the content into Swahili, which the government is trying to popularise in South Sudan to encourage integration into the East African Economic Community.  The end result is shown below, please play to see the Swahili translation in the captions. Note, for a client facing asset, you would also translate the title, filename and associated metadata into Swahili, the idea being search engines can properly index the content.\n  Aliir’s story: Swahili captions\n   Context Globally human trafficking is a serious law enforcement challenge. We do not particularly have ideas about how to combat this challenge. We think that serious people are looking into this, and if it makes sense for PM Morrison to make this video, there is probably good reason behind it, seeing as he has better access to information from law enforcement. Snippets from this video have surfaced on the Internet, below is from ABC News sourced from here.\n  Operation Sovereign Borders: Warning to People Smugglers\n   We picked our choice of video to translate below to show that not all stories fit in boxes, and solutions need to include this reality. It is possible to notice that people of African descent are over represented in the crime statistics, and to simultaneously recognise that having African genes can be an advantage for a sports person.\nThese issues are complicated, but we think more stories need to be heard, and maybe we get lucky and our product helps someone find their voice.\nSteps  The original video was sourced from the Border TV\u0026rsquo;s channel. Cynical minds may consider this a public relations exercise by the Department Of Home Affairs. However, these stories are real, and the information is well worth understanding before coming to conclusions on this very contentious topic.  Steps - Setting Up Swahili   So the first issue is that we need to add Swahili into our list of languages. Here we are assuming that you do not usually translate video content from English into Swahili, so you may need to add in this language.\n  Click into Finance, and check you have an appropriate set of languages. In the below image, we unfortunately do not have Swahili available. However, we are only using 4/5 of our available languages, so click and add Swahili and it will become available. To check you have successfully added Swahili, the tile should be green.\n    Finance: Language Settings shows we do not have Swahili available      The next step is to make sure our template is setup to handle Swahili. Click on myTemplate and then click to edit as shown below.\n    Edit the Template      Now, open up your Language Settings and Add Swahili. Note this is only required if you did not select Swahili when you signed up. This will already be in place if you signed up with Swahili. Here, we are assuming you need to translate a video into Swahili as a once off.\n    Edit the Template: Before Swahili is added        Edit the Template: After Swahili is added      Save and Exit your template. Then add a new item for the video content as shown below.\n    New Item: Using myTemplate now that Swahili has been added      Steps - Transcription, and Translation into Swahili   Upload the video, and click Transcribe. We used Australian English for the dialect here, as shown below.\n    Transcription: Australian English      After transcription, the below result is shown below. There was quite a lot of correction/addition after 1:30 -\u0026gt; 1:40. This is because Aliir is talking about a fairly emotional time for himself and his family, so the intonation is quite different, and the AI struggled with this.\n  Aliir’s story: English captions\n     Now we translate. Using the same Action -\u0026gt; Translation, we can translate from Australian English to Swahili.\n    Translation: Australian English to Swahili      The end result after the translation from English to Swahili is shown below. Note, for your own projects, always have someone who speaks the target language eyeball the results. The process shows an AI, which is likely to be very close to correct, but probably wrong in a few small ways.\n  Aliir’s story: Swahili captions\n     Conclusion In this post we tested the flow into Swahili. We are also hoping that you were able to see that most complicated stories have many sides, and any solution is likely to need both empathy and hard-headedness in equal measure.\nThe reality is that global human trafficking is a major law enforcement challenge. We do not know how to combat this challenge. However, we think a tool such as this could be used to provide more people with better access to information, in a language they understand.

As an added bonus, we can reach out to the people who made the original video, and normally, people are only too happy for us to experiment with their content.\nToday, we look at this video from the Kevin Richardson Foundation, starring Bongani the Lion, and Kevin. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who these folks are, you should totally go check out their Youtube channel, because the work they are doing is amazing.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s post, we are going to take this video from the LionWhispererTV and:\n Use the Speech-To-Text AI Transcription to transcribe the video.

Use the AI Translation from English to Afrikaans to translate the video.  Please note we have not cleaned up the Afrikaans text. The below video from LionWhispererTV is Bongani's Birthday. Bongani is the friendly male lion this video is about. In the video, Kevin refers to Bongani the lion as, 'a nice old man, but full of beans'.\n  LionWhispererTV: English (South Africa) with Afrikaans captions\n   We choose this video for two purposes, first the work that the Kevin Richardson Foundation is doing is pretty amazing. You only have to look at the video titled Lion Kisses here, to see what we are talking about. Trust me on this one.\nSecondly, a large part of their work is in raising awareness. While we have no idea what the exact level of awareness in South Africa relating to conservation efforts is, we do know South Africa has a large number of languages, and getting information out remains a challenge.\nSteps   The original video was sourced from the LionWhispererTV\u0026rsquo;s channel.

In this video, we see the following features:\n Kevin Richardson is speaking in clear South African English. So in this case, we obviously choose English (South Africa). It should be noted, that the clean up process was very short in the case of this particular video. One issue of note in Bongani’s Birthday! At 1:10 Kevin says, \u0026lsquo;there go Suja and Bongani\u0026rsquo;. The AI completely missed this line. In the end, we did not add it in, because it does not make a lot of sense in the context of what content will be translated, but the change in tone made a huge difference to the output of the transcription AI.

In this video, we see the following features:\n There are five people speaking using the following accents, Australian English, American English, English as spoken in Hong Kong, and English as spoken by a person of European descent. This is the crux of the problem, which AI should we use? While experimenting, we tried both English (Australian) and English (UK). The results were different, but it seemed liked the English (UK) worked a little bit better - this is probably because the first speaker, Professor Diana Slade, does not have a classic Australian accent, but more of a mix of Australian English and British English. For each of the speakers, the AI had trouble during a transition from one speaker to another. The first instance of this is at 0:18 seconds, which is a simple (and nifty) cut scene, but totally threw the AI. In essence, the AI likes monotone and the same person speaking. Dr Elizabeth Rider, speaking from 1:11 worked fairly well. This is because the underlying AI has been trained on a significant volume of American content. The exact opposite was true for the voice over by Dr Angela Chan. Additionally, switching between the HK English dialect, and the European English dialect, was ugly. All in all using the UK English worked better, in terms of number of post AI translation changes required. This is likely because if there is a mix of accents, going with base English, for lack of better descriptors, is probably the way to go.  Conclusion In this post we looked at some of the trade off\u0026rsquo;s between using different dialect AI\u0026rsquo;s for transcription. This is a valid concern for English, Arabic and Spanish, because these languages have the largest number of possible dialects.\nThe platform is currently in closed beta, while we work with early users to test/iron out issues.

In a normal workflow, you would have a Hindi speaker eyeball and clean up the text for a superior result. The results are shown below.\n  Gram Marg: An English video translated into Hindi\n     Heuristics   Now, we have the captions - but how good were the actual captions? The following observations can be made:\n The quality of the captions was mixed- for example the transcription from 0:20 -\u0026gt; 0:30 was not good. The AI did not transcribe Gram Marg properly in any instance. The quality of transcription from 1:24 -\u0026gt; 1:32 was not particularly good. Memorably, the word 'broadcaster' was transcribed to 'Brock Lesnar'. The narrator uses extra words, in terms of saying 'the' and 'a', and also a few other words which had to be manually removed. Capitalisation was incorrect in a number of places, and grammar also had to be corrected in some spots.    Why did these errors occur, and what can the human subject matter expert do to address these challenges? Some simple fixes, and their context, employed were:\n Quite simply, an AI is only as good as its training. The Gram Marg video was explicitly chosen to show the limitations of the AI. The training of the underlying Indian English AI is not very good - so whose fault is that? The training issue is no error. The simple truth is there is not enough video content in Indian English about this subject matter - the conversion of UHF (Ultra High Frequency) band white spaces into carriers for mobile hotspots. Because the content does not already exist the AI cannot be trained enough to provide a high level of accuracy. Incidentally this is the primary reason why Gram Marg exists, to provide a platform for increasing digital literacy in rural India. Specific to the broadcaster issue, at a very simple level - how many times is the AI likely to have heard the word 'broadcaster' in Indian English during training - probably not that many. How many times has the AI heard the word 'Brock Lesnar' during training - many more. The AI defaulted to what it knows. More broadly, this is explicitly what we mean by use the human subject matter expert to do the high value tasks.    Ok - sometimes the AI gets confused. What about the other errors?\n The narrator - Prof Abhay Karandikar - like anyone without extensive media training, speaks in a normal fashion. He is trying to explain the idea, and is thinking about his answers as he speaks. This is normal, but not entirely appropriate for the next step of AI translation, hence needed correction. But why is it not appropriate for AI translation? People speak in a different way to how they write, especially different to how they write formally. The translation AI is trained primarily on text, and a lot of that text is written in formal styles. Hence, the various idiosyncrasies of how people talk, simply do not translate well into other languages.    Conclusion The actual fixes are quite simple - do not use the platform as a one and done solution. The platform, and the AI\u0026rsquo;s are very good at doing the heavy lifting, but in the end, both are simply software.\n Once the AI has finished, have a human subject matter expert eyeball and fix the results. For the majority of content the changes are likely to be minor, because most video\u0026rsquo;s are made of simple concepts so that they can reach a wide audience. Mostly, add grammar and capitalisation. Also remove extra capitalisation.

The main task here, is to fix up the transcription. Practically, this means:\n Add grammar, in terms of comma's and full stops, in the correct places. The Speech-To-Text AI tries to use intonation to work this out and this does not work. People, when speaking, use intonation to denote importance. People do not use intonation in a \u0026lsquo;grammatically correct\u0026rsquo; fashion, making the AI\u0026rsquo;s attempts interesting. Add capitalisation - it was important to capitalise ChangePlan, this is what triggers the AI to tread this as a named entity, and not attempt to translate ChangePlan as two different words. Remove capitalisation - in certain places, where the narration was important, the AI treated this as named entities. In this video, that meant the word 'agile' ended up incorrectly capitalised in various places. One must ensure these are removed, other wise the translation AI in the next step gets confused.    It took a few minutes to make the above changes. Once complete, click Action -\u0026gt; Translation, to trigger the video captions being translated. This is a pretty simple process, and can be seen in the image below.\n    Trigger the Video Translation, with Hebrew for our to-language choice      The translation process will run in the background, and a few seconds later the Hebrew clone appears. Looking at the captions, we can see the below.\n    Hebrew Translations populated in the ChangePlan video      Please note, if you are looking for more options, including right to left text, you could use the Text Overlays, as opposed to Captions, which look something like below. It is also possible to change fonts, colour and opacity. In addition, add animated image overlays, or full video overlays, is also possible.\n    Hebrew Translations populated as Text Overlays in the ChangePlan video      On completion, the original video looks like below. Note, the Hebrew text has not been cleaned up in the below, mostly so the process can be fully documented.\n  ChangePlan: English, with Hebrew captions\n     Conclusion In this post we have covered how to translate your video from English to Hebrew.\nThe platform is currently in closed beta, while we work out bugs in the code.

Transcription is a process which converts speech (either live or recorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are often required for business, legal, or medical purposes.\nThe most common type of transcription is from a spoken-language source into text such as a computer file suitable for printing as a document such as a report.\nWHO ARE TRANSCRIPTS FOR?  Transcripts are very useful for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have some other hearing related disability. Adding transcripts to your content makes your content much more accessible. Making your content accessible is a good thing, but can also benefit you in unexpected ways. Hearing impaired people will often listen to your content, simply because transcripts are available, because they may not have many other choices! Many language learners find transcripts very useful, and would like to use your content to learn a foreign language. Reading the transcripts while they listen to the audio, or watch the video enables these listeners to enjoy your content. Transcripts are very good for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). For audio, this could mean show notes or episode descriptions. For video this could mean title, description and other social media specific metadata. In certain social media channels, where the video is mute-played, open captions may be very useful.  Many people find transcripts very useful.\nWHAT IS TRANSCRIBING AUDIO? HOW MANY KINDS OF AUDIO TRANSCRIPTIONS ARE THERE? Transcribing audio is the process of converting an audio file from speech to text. For the most common case of podcasting, when transcribing audio there are three different approaches:\nSHOW NOTES (ALSO KNOWN AS EPISODE DESCRIPTIONS) It is very useful to add comprehensive show notes or episode descriptions. For good SEO we highly recommend:\n Write a thorough description making sure you spell check and grammar check. Highlight topics covered in the podcast while being mindful of commonly used search terms and topics. Add relevant links and resources, this will help your podcast rank better on search engines.  TRANSCRIPTS If done correctly transcripts of your podcast can be very useful. Follow the below guidelines:\n Post Edit your transcript to ensure accuracy. Remove unscripted banter such as \u0026lsquo;umms\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;ahhs\u0026rsquo; to make the transcript more suitable for search engines to index. Avoid repeated content which may be present in the introduction and closing portions of your podcast. If available, add a pdf or epub to the social media channel you are using to describe your podcast.  If you are looking to make your podcast accessible to hearing impaired, or otherwise disabled people, closed captioning should be added directly to the media file. Note that transcripts often do not syndicate with the underlying media object directly.\nCLOSED CAPTIONING Closed captioning is similar to transcripts. However, it will often include additional information for accessibility requirements, such as [CLAPPING] or [LAUGHTER] to describe events in the podcast.\n Add closed captions if you wish to make your podcast more accessible. Closed captions can be inserted into audio files like mp3/m4a audio and mp4/m4v video. Closed captions are generally inserted using ID3 tags in mp3 files for example. Depending on your use case, it may also be useful to provide a pdf transcript of your podcast.  WHAT MAKES FOR AN EFFECTIVE AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION? For much more effective audio transcription we recommend you consider the below suggestions.\nSPELLING AND GRAMMAR It is very important you do post-editing after any machine transcription. Even if you have manually transcribed your content, it is highly recommended you check the work prior to publishing.\nBad spelling and grammar makes reading your content harder, and any transcripts may not get indexed appropriately by search engines due to reduced accuracy.\nAnother Artificial Intelligence/Machine Language limitation is that people do not speak the same as they write. It is often required to add appropriate spelling edits (such as capitalisation for proper nouns) and grammar (the most common case is full-stops) post AI transcription.\nSIGNIFIERS It is quite important that you add signifiers to your transcript. This is doubly important for audio or podcast transcripts. This includes the number of speakers, names of the speakers, any characters the speakers may be playing, background noise, manner of speech etc.\nFORMATTING Formatting is often overlooked. There are two cases where this is quite important.\n In audio transcripts, consistency in marking speaker tags, indentation as well as font, and maintaining the same pattern throughout the whole document, are all very important to get right. The idea is that a nicely formatted audio transcript should be easy to read and make the experience a pleasurable one. In video transcription, use technology such as auto-overlay to use a nice font, font-size, font-colour to make it easy for the viewer to follow along. This is especially important in social media where the underlying video may be likely to be played in a audio-mute environment.  SUMMARISING, VERBATIM OR SHOW NOTES The idea here is to add appropriate information, both for your audience and for search engines (so your audience can find your content!).\n Summarising: This is very useful for short description fields in various social media channels. Verbatim: Use this for closed captions to promote accessibility for your content. Show Notes: Use this for long form social media search indexing. Ensure you do keyword searches and optimise for SEO/SEM.  HOW DO YOU TRANSCRIBE AUDIO? To transcribe audio content, follow the below process.\n Select your preferred language template, and create a new item. Upload your video and click Actions \u0026gt; Transcribe. Select the language and dialect of the video and click the accept button to trigger the transcription. The transcription process will run in the background. Once the transcription is complete, go through and check the transcription for proper grammar e.g. capitalisation and full stops. Embed the captions into the asset, or download the srt file separately.  HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TRANSCRIBE AUDIO? While there is no official metric for how long transcription takes, when transcribing manually, it is generally accepted that transcription will take 4:1, or about four (4) times as long as the underlying content being transcribed.\nSo, for a fifteen (15) minute audio file, it would take about one (1) hour to transcribe manually. This is good for slow, clear speakers, with not much muffled or garbled audio and no one speaking over each other.\nMachine transcription is much quicker, but is affected by different factors. File size, bit rates, Internet speed, all these factors affect translation speeds. An easy approach is to use small files (video) optimised for the social media channel you are looking to deploy to, and not worry too much as AI is very quick.\nIn machine translation, you can use the rule of thumb as 1:4, or about quarter (1/4) times as long as the underlying content being transcribed. So, for a one (1) hour audio file, it would take about fifteen (15) minutes to transcribe with an Artificial Intelligence (AI), assuming a relatively high quality video file.\nWHAT FACTORS THAT AFFECT TRANSCRIPTION TIME FOR PEOPLE? Several factors can affect transcription time for people. We recommend you use Video Translator to do the first pass of the transcription, and then spend your time post-editing the result for maximum effectiveness.\nHowever, you may need to spend more time editing, under the following circumstances.\n Audio quality Single speaker or many? A worked example here. Background noise Coherence: Do the different speakers talk over each other? Are they emotional when they speak, and is it easy to understand? Do they speak quickly or slowly? Regional dialects: Make sure you choose the correct dialect from the available options to improve the transcription accuracy. Nomenclature: Names, places, specialised terminology, subject matter specific shorthand etc.  HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO TRANSCRIBE AUDIO? The cost varies depending on the length of your audio. If you you are using Pay-As-You-Go, this costs 30 cents/minute, and 15 cents/minute if you subscribe. Learn more about our pricing structure here.\nCAN I TRANSCRIBE AUDIO WITHOUT A VIDEO? Yes. If you have a separate audio file, you do not need a video to use Video Translator to transcribe audio. Simply upload the audio file into an audio component, and use the AI to transcribe you preferred language and dialect.\nHOW CAN I ADD CAPTIONS TO A VIDEO? How to add captions to a video using Video Translator:\n Select your preferred language template, and create a new item. Upload your video and click Actions \u0026gt; Transcribe. Alternately, if you already have captions, copy and paste this into the Captions tab. Click the \u0026lsquo;Add Captions\u0026rsquo; button to add to embed captions to a video. Alternately, for additional styling options, use the Auto-Overlay functionality.  HOW TO EMBED SUBTITLES INTO VIDEO USING OUR AUTO-OVERLAY FEATURE? Our Auto Overlay feature allows you to embed subtitles into a video rather than keeping them separately in an srt file. Here’s how:\n Once you\u0026rsquo;ve transcribed your captions, click Action \u0026gt; Auto-Overlay. Then select your video asset. From here, you can customise the font, font-size, font-color, and opacity. Next you can add a striped background behind your text, or a proportionally inserted highlight. You can choose the colour and opacity of your highlight. Click confirm. Your video asset is now ready to download with embedded subtitles and your preferred styling. You can see more detailed instructions on how to embed subtitles into video using our auto overlay feature on our blog here.  HOW TO EMBED SUBTITLES INTO MP4? We see this question a lot as it is the most common video type across social media platforms. As long as you have the transcription text or srt file, you can embed subtitles into your mp4 or any format video file.\nHOW CAN I TRANSLATE A VIDEO? It is simple to translate any video with Video Translator.\nTRANSCRIBE THE AUDIO  Select myTemplate and create a new item. Upload your video and click Actions \u0026gt; Transcribe. Select the language and dialect of the video. Click Accept. The transcription process will run in the background. Once the transcription is complete, go through and check the transcription for proper grammar e.g. capitalization and full stops. Click the + button to add it to your video.  TRANSLATE THE CAPTIONS OR SUBTITLES  Once you have the captions, click Action \u0026gt; Translation. Select your preferred language. Click Accept. The translation process will run in the background. After the translation is complete, a new file will appear with transcription in the new language. We recommend having someone who speaks the language copy edit it. Now you can add captions to your video. We have detailed instructions on translating a video from English here.  TRANSCRIBE THE NOW TRANSLATED CAPTIONS INTO SPEECH  Open your translated text file and copy paste the captions into the audio file. Click Transcribe File and select from the available voices. Add the audio into the original video asset as an overlay. Remember to mute the original audio so that you can hear only the translated language when the video plays. You can see an example of translating audio into German here.  HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TRANSLATE A VIDEO? There are several factors which can impact translation time.\n The AI translation will happen very quickly in seconds. It is highly recommended that you engage a human for post-editing.

That is, they require translation services as an adjunct to their core concerns. The requirement might be one-off/event driven, a very specific but relatively small requirement, or have legislative/regulatory drivers.\nSo the requirement exists, but there is no reason to rebuild operations to offer multilingual support. A very common use case is one-off requirements for translation, say to support a pitch to a client who is overseas. Post pitch, this is often reused in a multilingual website for the SEO benefits. Read a case study.\nPart Of A Larger Process Everyone understands the inherent power of language. If you can successfully move your service into another language - show me the money!\nBut how to do this right? Its expensive, complex and has an uncertain ROI.\nA number of our clients use our managed services as a stop gap while they build out the in-house capability for the ongoing production of translated content.\nOutside Core Competence The core of our value proposition is ROI. As in, for content spend of X, spend an additional small amount and now your content is multilingual.\nA number of innovative firms want to spend their time focused on their own value proposition, and do not want to build up a multilingual team. In this case, we offer bespoke solutions ranging from the Internationalization of apps, research into keywords in different languages and market research around language sensitivities.\nCHALLENGES AROUND SERVICE LOCALIZATION AND INTERNATIONALIZATION     Challenges around service localization and internationalization    Challenges Around Service Localization And Internationalization While localization and internationalization initiatives generally have executive backing, bringing the entire team along - development, marketing and sales - is required to execute successfully.\nSo the question becomes, what small / low cost steps can you take to start the project, and how to show a positive ROI every step of the way.\nQ: Where do we start? We have several websites, some apps and our billing is on two systems! We would recommend starting with a few short video\u0026rsquo;s. You will be required to provide the video, any background music and select the languages you want to target.\nWhy? Because the hard thing about service delivery in other languages is bringing your team along.\nHow do you get from only English all the way to an translated value proposition. Book a call today!\nQ: My development team is too busy and does not have the bandwidth for another project! We understand.\nThe key thing to remember is the majority of your value proposition does not have to be translated.\nThe parts that bring in new business, those HAVE TO BE translated.\nWe are here to help. Book a call today!\nEXOTIC LANGUAGES     We can advise you on website translation to maximise SEO    Exotic Languages Multiple languages are hard to work with operationally. We take the view that the smart way to do this is to try a number of different options.\nGive your sales people and marketing staff something to work with!\n    Source: Think with Google, YouTube Internal Data, U.S., March 2019–May 2019    Lets say that your business has sales people in English only. How would you create Spanish collateral? We are essentially doing the same thing just with video.\nAs you have outsourced the heavy lifting, this collateral can be provided to a Spanish speaking colleague to work with directly. But more importantly, once deployed online provides an ongoing set of leads from the Spanish SEO.\nBut Spanish is not exotic? Exactly, irrespective of the target culture, there is no way to work out how much demand your product has unless you try the market. Our value proposition is that you can now try a very large number of potential markets with a very low starting cost.\nTalk to us to learn more about our capabilities in unusual languages.\nACCESSIBILITY Regulatory drivers are quite important for a large number of our clients. In Australia for example, there is a focus on providing options for sight and hearing impaired people.\nA standard solution here is to use open captions. This covers the disability use cases, providing support to older people, and is also related to people who prefer open captions.\nAn added benefit of open captions is the providing a simple way to deploy content into social media channels (like LinkedIn or Facebook) where video content auto-plays but is muted.\nCONCLUSION  Use our experts to quickly evaluate a non-English prospect market. Who are the players, who is the competition? Build out a micro-site in the target language, limiting your offering to known opportunities. If it works, then spend the money setting up a local presence. Reuse your prior/current investment in content, by scaling across languages. This includes text, image, audio or video content. Use capabilities like multi-lingual forms to manage complex workflow.

StarCraft II is a real-time strategy game by Blizzard Entertainment, which has become a staple of the eSports community. Professional play has been ongoing since the game\u0026rsquo;s initial release in 2010, following on the success of StartCraft and StarCraft: Brood Wars, both of which had substantial eSports fan bases.\nThat is, StarCraft II is a computer game which has been played competitively for ~ 20 years. Major leagues in this include the Korean eSports Association (KeSPA), Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) World Championships and BlizzCon, with professionals making 250K+ on prize money alone. Find the global rankings here.\nDeepMind's latest/greatest AI AlphaStar, just beat a top ranked StarCraft II player. This post is about what happened, what it means and how to think about AI sensibly. AlphaStar is the evolution of other Alpha- projects,AlphaZero for Chess and AlphaGo for Go.\nStarCraft II - Basic Rules for Humans and Machines The StarCraft franchise has a large/complex storyline (lore in gamer-speak) which sets up the games, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t terribly important. Here is what you need to know:\n  There are three main factions, Protoss (advanced alien), Terran (future human) and Zerg (bugs ala Starship Troopers), each with unique units. The way to think of this from a game theory perspective is as a complex version of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n    StarCraft II game play: Protoss (Gold), Terran (Blue) and Zerg (Red)      The play is generally between 2 players and takes places on tournament maps. Tournament maps are generally modified to include multi level terrain with high ground advantage, strategic choke points, terrain modifiers which impact unit speed, range and hit points among others. A standard complexity 1v1 map is shown below.\n    StarCraft II (1v1) map, normal start would be at top left and bottom right      There are two basic resources, minerals and gas. Some maps also have a special minerals which translates to quicker unit production. The other major issue is fog of war which translates to incomplete knowledge of the map, necessitating scouting, cheesing and other assorted mind-games.\n  The players actions are basically, build mining units to get resources, use resources to make weapon units, and kill other players weapon units while surviving yourself. As such, the build order (the order in which you build units and structures to maximise chances of winning) becomes super important, not least because the times for specific strategies are well known, leading to timing attacks.\n  StarCraft II - Micro and Macro Game   Micro refers to the ability of the player to perfectly control their units. Units in StarCraft II often have abilities. A simple example is something like a MedEvac unit allows other units to load up, and also heals. Being proficient in micro allows a player to perform better in ground level engagements.\n  Macro refers to the ability of the player to match their opponent in building bases and drones, the idea being to successfully min/max unit production.\n  Another consideration around macro refers to strategy transitions. Each race whether Protoss, Terran or Zerg has a technology tree which allows players to make unit composition choices. An example of this in Terran, is the choice between bio - which refers to units like marines and snipers (Ghost) or mech - which refers to tanks etc.\n  To understand the differences, please have a look at this guide. This is important, because to think about the relative strengths of the AI, the real test is AlphaStar's ability to balance Micro and Macro game.\n  Visually in the below example, red goes hard on unit production early attempting to win with good micro, but blue focuses on macro game, and wins. Note, the graph is of Army Value (think unit count hence micro focus).\n    Red focuses on unit production, while Blue focuses on macro game to win      AlphaStar - Abilities + Limitations Well described in the original blog post, are the challenges that the DeepMind team faced when training their AI. These include: game theory - no single best strategy, imperfect information, long term planning, real-time and large action space. Also included in that post is the basic process of how the training worked. What you need to know:\n  The AI was trained using an advanced generative adversarial network (GAN) AI. This is a fancy way of saying they took multiple AI's (agents) and made them play against each other. So the final AI has the equivalent of 200 years of StarCraft II gaming experience.\n  The AI was trained on (and can only play) Protoss vs Protoss - that is one faction against itself only, and on Catalyst shown below.\n    StarCraft II (1v1) map Catalyst, where AlphaStar played MaNa from Team Liquid      The AI was limited to control the units in a way which emulates human limitations. So the AI was limited to under 300 APM (actions per minute). This is on the low end compared to professional players, the world champion Serral averages ~450 APM.\n  Additionally, the AI is also limited see the map like a human, it cannot just flick around and see everything, it is limited using a screens per minute to simulate human reaction times. It must virtually click around to trigger actions and look at different places on the map. The primary role of AlphaStar is to look around, prioritize its actions and engage in unit control in engagements.\n  What Happened - Cheeses + Mind Games   AlphaStar beat MaNa 5-0. Ok - so this was not totally unexpected. It should also be noted, that the human players were NOT playing their preferred faction in StarCraft II, because AlphaStar currently can only play Protoss v Protoss, on Catalyst LE. It can\u0026rsquo;t do anything else.\n  Cheese most often refers to an unexpected strategy that relies in large parts on lack of information and/or psychological impact on the opponent. Cheese build orders typically revolve around an early attack that, if undetected, is more difficult to defend than execute.\n  Have a look at this to find examples of more cheeses. Cheesing is most effective when mixed with mind games, most of which reflect imperfect knowledge about what your opponent is doing, relying on fog of war.\n  In this clip, (i) TLO sends over a probe to scout, (ii) AlphaStar sees the probe detect a stargate, (iii) waits until the probe no longer has visibility, and (iv) cancels the stargate.\n  AlphaStar plays mind games with LiquidTLO\n     This behavior is very human like, but why it is doing some of these things is not entirely clear. For example, seen here something interesting happens. The AI overproduces probes on the first base (that is, it saturates the base and hence the base efficiency is lower) where as a human would not do this and you would think that a machine would also not do this, seeing as the AI is likely to understand going over 100% reduces efficiency - but AlphaStar does any way.\n  AlphaStar over-saturates its main base, getting 19/16 drones\n     Conclusion  On watching the stream, and you should totally check it out, I was impressed, intrigued and a little bit terrified. Which seems like an appropriate response. AlphaStar seemed to have a lot of trouble with macro transitions. So a fairly textbook strategy for Terran would be, (i) start with bio - marines/marauders, (ii) transition to mech by mid game and, (iii) then move to air units for late game. AlphaStar cannot (from my understanding of its training regime) respond to this kind of play. AlphaStar tends to start with a composition, and then make minor changes. This makes sense when you think about how the neural network was trained. The main place where AlphaStar absolutely blew me away, was its micro control. So there were large parts of the games where the Actions Per Minute (APM) for AlphaStar was in the 60's, whereas its human opponent was at 300+. But looking at the play, the micro was amazing. AlphaStar is obviously a computer, so you would expect it to NOT make mistakes clicking around, but it is still very impressive. Will AI\u0026rsquo;s like AlphaStar dominate StarCraft II going forward - absolutely not. StarCraft maps, to provide just one example, are evolving towards allowing players to using deeper macro strategy - such as, where should my 3rd base be is less of a tactical decision and more of a strategic decision going forward, which makes it immeasurably harder for an AI to win.  However, the longer term implication is pretty clear, DeepMind took an AI and is teaching it to mimic a gestalt consciousness (Zerg is an exo-galactic hive mind in StarCraft II lore). This might not end well :)\nExtra You should totally check out the LowkoTV and WinterStarcraft channels if this was interesting.

We get many (welcome) questions from prospects/clients on how to use the platform. Additionally, because we are a new start up, we don't have great documentation. How to solve this problem with limited bandwidth?\nThe requirement is pretty simple, an easy way to communicate with prospects and clients, which stacks. The stacking aspect is the idea that effort today should not just be useful today, but also should compound in some way.\nA forum could meet this requirement quite nicely. First, it allows us to link a natural extension to blog posts, in a questions? comments? continue the discussion here... way. Second, it should help us provide better support to our clients as we answer complex questions on how to use the product.\nHow does a forum stack? If the forum software is relatively modern, the questions asked and answers provided become a shareable resource. These questions and answers can be indexed by search engines, can be queried, and basically turn into a very useful knowledge base which prospects, clients and staff can refer to as the need arises.\nDo We Need A Forum? We started by looking around for what a forum does? The folks at WiseGeek have an article which covers the basics, An Internet forum is a discussion area on a website. Website members can post discussions and read and respond to posts by other forum members. A forum can be focused on nearly any subject and a sense of an online community, or virtual community, tends to develop among forum members.\nClearly though, there is more to forums than just the above. Some of the complexities of running a forum can be seen from the comments below the same article. The long and short of it is: ymmv, or your mileage may vary.\n    Comments on an article about Internet Forums    So this could get exciting. However, our choice to build a forum was made with the following objectives in mind:\n Build A Community - this lets us know what prospects/clients think of our product, and what we can do to improve it. Crowd Source Service and Support - this is a cheap way to provide support from the existing user base. But, the quality of the support varies. This can be a double edged sword. Social CRM - a form of CRM where the interaction between client and vendor is mediated through a social media channel.  If you want to read more about these tradeoff\u0026rsquo;s, this article from 2010 covers some of the concerns.\nWhat Do We Need From A Forum? Okay, we are getting a forum. Which one though? Below is some of our requirements when picking a forum.\n We want a nice new piece of software. Our own stack is, React, Meteor, Node, and Mongo. So we were looking for Node JS solution\u0026rsquo;s as opposed to PHP, though we would be happy to consider a Ruby-On-Rails or some other modern software solution. We use a lot of cloud hosting, and as a startup firm, want to be conscious of cost. So in an ideal world, we can get something which is open source to start with, self host, and then later move to a hosted solution when we are happy to pay someone else to manage it. Want a nice way to manage users, mostly to ensure that trolls and other toxic commenters are kept out. Largely, ensuring the forum is focused on our technology and how it is being used, should manage most of these issues for us. Want to be able to use the forum as a knowledge base, so it should be relatively simple to add images and other hypermedia to the forum. Some gamification, because as usesrs of forums, we know how much of a difference that makes.      Interaction badges used in Forum Software    As heuristics go, we are big fans of Meteor, and their forums in terms of providing prospects and clients with answers in a timely manner. There are a number of articles we looked at like this, this and this which gave us some ideas. The key point to consider is how forums are different, in terms of the structural elements of managing the interactions between users - the last link is to a Reddit thread which covers many of these concerns.\nFor us, we decided to not get cute and stick with the Discourse forum.\nHow To Setup Discourse On A Digital Ocean Server? We added a discourse forum to the website. The people at discourse define the project as, Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet. Use it as a mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chat room, and more!\nGiven we are a new startup, the plan was to not use the hosted discourse solution, but instead build out a self hosted forum. The actual building out of the forum was very simple, and probably took a total of 2 hours from start to finish.\nSteps To Setup Digital Ocean Server, MailGun Emails And A Discourse Forum.   We are on Digital Ocean infrastructure, so we picked an off the shelf $10/month Ubuntu 18.04.1 box, with 2GB of RAM as that is the minimum requirement Discourse has - its just a Docker image. The process is detailed (here)[https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/discourse/], and looks like the below image - all we are doing is initialising a new droplet with a Docker image of the latest Discourse.\n    Digital Ocean 1-Click-Deploy      We also selected the Singapore data centre, extra monitoring and added an SSH key. It took a few minutes to build, and this was all pretty straightforward. We need to setup MailGun properly before we can log into our new Discourse deployment. Note: We use MailGun for our email infrastructure.\n  A bigger challenge was setting up MailGun which the Discourse forum needs for emails. The Discourse forum will need the below MailGun settings to work properly. Assume some additional time for the records to refresh and for typo\u0026rsquo;s if you are not a DevOps specialist.\n SMTP Hostname - smtp.mailgun.org SMTP Login - postmaster@forums.your-domain.com Password - your-complicated-default-password    Please note the Domain Verification and DNS settings in your MailGun. These settings will need to be put into Digital Ocean in the networking setup (or where ever you manage you DNS settings). Specifically, you will require the below records added.\n CNAME - email.forums.your-domain.com [Hostname]; mailgun.org. (value); TXT - mx._domainkey.forums.your-domain.com [Hostname]; some-large-key-autogenerated-by-mailgun (value); TXT - forums.your-domain.com [Hostname]; v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all (value); A - forums.your-domain.com [Hostname]; your-digitalocean-ip (value);    Once the above records have been added to your DNS settings, verify that MailGun can see this information properly. The button is shown below.\n    MailGun DNS Verification      Once the verification is happy, we will need to setup the Discourse forum on our server. We already have the droplet, so log in ssh root@your-digitalocean-ip. On successfully logging in, the droplet will run a startup script which will need the above information (and an administrator email/password). Note this will all happen in Terminal or your specific command-line tool.\n  We also need another email address, for the Let's Encrypt digital certificate. Once complete, the Docker image will run an update cycle to the latest Discourse source code, do a (re-)compile and start the process. Once complete, exit the server. Now go to the ip in your browser, specifically to http://your-ip.\n  The setup is simple from here on - this resource has some screen shots, but largely its just adding some branding information. This resource shows how to do the install without the 1-click deploy, which may also be useful. Once complete, go to your https://forums.your-domain.com and you will see something similar to the below.\n    Video Translator forum deployed successfully      Conclusion The platform is currently in closed beta, while we work out bugs in the code. Now however, you are able to post questions on our new forum, and hopefully we can start getting some useful information up. Additionally, we will be adding topics from posts into the forum, so please feel free to add your feedback, or any questions you may have on our new forum.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nIf you are interested in trying out our technology, please drop us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-to-add-a-forum-to-your-website/","tags":["English"],"title":"How To Add A Forum To Your Website"},{"categories":["Transcription","Translation","Video"],"contents":"Today we are going to look at how to transcribe a foreign language video. But how does this work when we live in a globalised world where people are from many different places - exactly what is foreign?\nWell, Video Translator\u0026rsquo;s platform provides a client with the ability to transcribe and translate content to/from a number of languages, as discussed here.\nWhat we are looking at today, is how to transcribe a video in an language you do not know. Mostly, we will make changes to a template, and implement these changes in our items. Here, we have Hindi captions on a speech by Narendra Modi, the current Indian Prime Minister. The assumption is, we do not know Hindi.\nNote, no edits have been made to the underlying text, not after the transcription, or after the translation, hence the accuracy is low. As always, we recommend using the AI to do the heavy lifting, and using a human subject-matter expert to clean up the results.\nNo really, use a subject matter expert and do not cheap out on translators. This tool is built to increase efficiency, not short change staff/contractors.\n  Narendra Modi speech with English captions\n   Context It is important to understand what we are doing. We want to transcribe the speech, but we do NOT know Hindi, hence cannot translate this content. So we will pretend to translate our template, but actually simply set it up to expect Hindi content.\nThen we add the Hindi content, but because the original template was in English, we can bring back the content (translate back from Hindi -\u0026gt; English). Effectively a four transform process, English template -\u0026gt; Hindi template -\u0026gt; Hindi item, and lastly because the original template was in English, we can take our Hindi item -\u0026gt; English item.\nIt may be useful to also look at this post to understand the strategy we are using. We will be modifying our templates to work with multiple languages, its just that in this case we do not know the language we are trying to use. The video content is publicly available content sourced from Rajya Sabha TV.\nSteps - Template   Please direct your browser to videotranslator.ai and log into the application. Once logged in, open up a new template, or just use our old friend, myTemplate. Note, we are in a collection named Sydney - your collection is likely to be called MyTeam. Please have a look at account settings to make any changes.\n  Open up myTemplate, and check the Language Options to see something similar to the below image. In collection Sydney we have access to several languages including English, French, Hindi, Chinese, Portuguese and Hebrew. We will only be working with English (our primary language) and Hindi (one of our secondary languages) in this post.\n    Template showing Language Options - English/Hindi      Now, we are not looking to overlay any audio, so we can remove the audio component. However, we will translate it for illustration purposes, showing how to use the translation function on templates.\n  First, to translate this template into Hindi, click the Action -\u0026gt; Translate function. Now, do not select the video component, but only select the audio component. We do not need the audio component, but are translating it anyway to show what the Hindi item will look like.\n    Translate the audio, but not the video      This should give us a new Hindi template, which looks like the below. Note, the video component is NOT translated, while the audio component IS translated. We will not be using the audio component in this post, but any item of type hi_myTemplate will show the video component in English, and the audio component in Hindi.\n    Hindi Template, with Audio component translated      Note that in the Language Options above, this template shows Hindi as its primary language, and Hindi and English as secondary languages. That is, items of this template are expected to be in Hindi, and can we translated to English as required.\n  Steps - Item   We setup our Hindi template following the steps above, now we can use this to reach our goal of transcribing the Hindi video. Add a new item called modi_hindi and upload the content as required. The below image shows what our new item looks like prior to uploading the video.\n    Add a new item of type: hi_myTemplate        Item, with video in English and audio in Hindi      Again, we do not need the audio component. The only reason we translated it, is to show how we can selectively translate specific components depending on our workflow. We will only be using the video component.\n  Upload the video, and then transcribe to get the captions as required. This looks like below.\n  Narendra Modi speech with Hindi captions\n     We can now see the captions have been populated. Note, general workflow would include using a Hindi subject matter expert to clean up the captions.\n    Hindi captions with font, colour and size options      In this post, we have NOT cleaned up the Hindi transcription. This is BAD example, because as a political speech, the majority of it is using humour, in jokes etc to reach the audience - none of which is a strong point for an AI. AI works best with thing type content. The more subtle the context, the less likely an AI is to do work properly. Please use subject-matter experts with content of this nature.\n  Below, the translated version (into English) is shown, and watching it will show the errors. The error compounds, because (i) our transcript is not great, (ii) our translation was based on the same dodgy transcript.\n  Narendra Modi speech with English captions\n     Conclusion In this blog post we have covered how to transcribe a video in a foreign language. We specifically used this example, to show the limitations of AI. As always, use the AI to do the heavy lifting, but get a subject matter expert to think about your content and finesse the results to the needs of your audience.\nThe platform is currently in closed beta, while we work out bugs in the code.

For everyday interactions, this is fine, but every now and then, it can get messy.\nDoes this resonate with you? An important client in Asia needs something, and they are not happy. However, the operations person you are speaking to does not speak great English, and so an important deal has been bungled. If you\u0026rsquo;re particularly unlucky, right now while you are reading this post, said deal IS being bungled.\nThis post is going to cover how to build multi lingual forms, so that you can get information to and from different parts of your organisation effectively. It assumes you have either (i) overseas outsourced service provider who may not have good communication skills (in English), or (ii) overseas export prospects/clients with staff who you have to deal with, who also lacks communication skills (in English).\nSpecifically, we will take a simple form in English, and translate to French (our assumed non English speaking client) and Hindi (our assumed outsourced service provider).\n    Sample form (Original)        Sample form in French        Sample form in Hindi    Steps   Please direct your browser to videotranslator.ai, and then click on the Login button. Once logged in, create a new template called myMultiLingualTemplate.\n    Add a new template: myMultiLingualTemplate      On entering myMultiLingualTemplate, click on View and select to show Language Settings. This should look like below - please note, this specific subscription is an enterprise subscription with English as the primary language, and French and Hindi as secondary languages.\n  We are simulating an organisation with English as our primary language spoken across the organisation. In this specific case, we will pretend our organisation has an external client in France, hence the French, and an outsourced back office in India, hence the Hindi. Removing any secondary language will mean items of this template cannot be translated into the unselected language. Please close Language Settings once complete.\n    Language Settings showing secondary languages - French and Hindi      We can now add different components. In this post we will stick to fields, which both retail and enterprise subscriptions have access to, but please note complex (nested) data structures can be handled with generics.\n    Building a Template: Generics        Building a Template: Fields      So we are just going to add one text field here - where are you from - in the form. Click to add a text field, and the result looks like below. Note that the Information has been changed from Please upload Text content? to Where are you from? in our example.\n    Adding a Text component: Where are you from?      Above, please also note the additional collections available. Essentially template knows its items are expected to move between collections Sydney, Mumbai and Paris. The eye icon denotes read permissions, and the pencil icon denotes write permissions.\n  The process is almost complete. Now, we simply translate the template and get the translated versions - one for French and one for Hindi. Each template can now produce items as required.\n    Translated to French        Translated to Hindi      Once complete, the forms look like below. Again, the use case for this is, (i) the French form is for a client in Paris, who wants to fill out the form in French, and (ii) the Hindi form is for the outsourced service provider in Mumbai, who wants to fill out the form in Hindi.\n    Sample form in French        Sample form in Hindi      Above, please note the transliteration option in the Hindi form - in an ideal world, your client fills in this form using a computer set to a French keyboard (or Hindi keyboard), however this might not be the case. The transliteration service allows for a user to type Hindi into a English keyboard, and the transliteration is phonetic.\n  Due to the nature of the platform, the French form or Hindi form above, when filled in can be brought back to English (using translate again), so that the English speaking staff can work with the form information.\n  Conclusion This is a fairly complex post, and largely, it is not expected that the average user will need to use this functionality.

Information about the Finance section will be covered in a later post.\nThis post is written to explain the use cases of account management, and why options are laid out as they are - if we have reached out to you for feedback, please feel free to come back with ideas on how you use/would like to use the interface. We welcome the feedback.\nRoot: Top-Right Navigation   Please direct your browser to videotranslator.ai, and then click on the Login button.\n  In the below image, the following is visible, (i) top-right navigation bar showing Root \u0026gt; MyTeam, (ii) top-left hamburger options, (ii) top-left information bar showing Root, Credit, and Help, (iv) folders and files, and (v) folder actions. Note we will talk about folders and files and their respective actions in another blog post.\n    Application Interface on Login      The top-right navigation bar, showing Root \u0026gt; MyTeam refers to a one-to-many relationship between Entity and Collection. Entity here refers to your organisation, whether for profit corporation, non profit, or government. Collection simply refers to a set of users with access to assets.\n  Clicking on Root takes us to the global, within which we can see our Entity -\u0026gt; MyCompany. If our specific user had access to multiple Entities, we would see them here. Note: don\u0026rsquo;t worry about this if you have just signed up. Additionally, we have clicked on MyCompany, showing the option to view inside this entity.\n    Root: Global view showing entity \u0026#39;MyCompany\u0026#39;      Clicking on the View, will bring us down one level, to our team MyTeam.

Clicking on John Smith is simply a shortcut to the Root \u0026gt; MyTeam collection.\n    Top-left navigation hamburger showing account management options      Account is personal account settings, allowing chnages to (i) user name, (ii) user email and user password reset.\n  Root: Top-Left Information   Clicking on the cloud takes you to your Root. Please note, access to multiple entities and users is available to all subscribed users, while access to multiple collections is limited to the enterprise subscription. Clicking on Root anywhere will automatically redirect you to your assets.\n    Top-left information bar showing Root, Credit and Help      The $ shows the available credit linked to this subscription. Clicking here will take you to the Finance section. Similarly, clicking Help will take you to the help section. Another valuable resource is on the documentation page.\n  Management: General Settings + Collection Settings   Please use the top-left navigation to go to the Management section. This should look something like below.\n    Management: General Settings      It is possible to change the name of your Entity here - in the below image we changed the name of our Entity from MyCompany -\u0026gt; Sample Firm, which can be seen in the Root.\n    Root: MyCompany -\u0026gt; Sample Firm      Next we look at the Collection Settings. If you have an enterprise subscription, this is where you can add multiple collections. The below image however, shows a retail subscription with the original collection only, MyTeam. On clicking MyTeam, we also see options to, (i) Update Languages, (ii) Update Access, and (iii) Properties.\n    Management: Selected \u0026#39;MyTeam\u0026#39; to manage languages, users and properties      It is possible to add and remove AI\u0026rsquo;s here - if you are looking at the enterprise subscription, please contact us for custom AI deployments and white label solutions. In the below however, we can see 3 AI\u0026rsquo;s, a Text-To-Text AI, two transcription AI\u0026rsquo;s - one for Speech-To-Text and the other for Text-To-Speech. The last option is the Human 1, which is to add specific sets of human resources to the workflow.\n    Management: Managing AI permissions on a per Collection basis      User permission management, on a permissions per collection basis, is also managed here. Our specific entity, now called Sample Firm has only one user, John Smith. Additionally, we also have only one collection, MyTeam. Mathematically (set theory), this represents a one-to-many relationship between Entities -\u0026gt; Collections, and a one-to-many relationship between Entities-\u0026gt;Users. The permissions cover the relationship between the Users and Entities, this of course is defined as a many-to-many.\n  Click the User Availability to turn on/off access to this collection. Click the specific permission to turn it on/off for the specific user in a specific collection. The permissions are fairly self explanatory, please contact the support desk for more information.\n    Management: Managing user permissions on a per Collection basis      Management: User Settings   While it is all well and good to change permissions, how do you add/remove additional users? Jump over to the user settings. We can do two things here, (i) give existing users Management and Finance permissions, and (ii) add new users from outside our entity.\n    Management: Managing user permissions on Entity basis      Click on John Smith, we as management can add/remove permissions to Management and Finance. This is effectively an equivalent of an Administrator function. Additionally, we can also reset the users password here. Please note, the user will still need to verify their email and/or work through 2FA.\n    Management: Administrator style permissions and password controls      Similarly, we can invite other users (internal or external) using the panel below. Please note, what we are doing here, is adding external users to our collection under some preferred permission set. The idea is we invite resources to our collection, so they can do some specific task as part of our workflow.\n    Management: Add an external user      Conclusion This is a fairly complex post, and largely, it is not expected that the average user will need to use this functionality.

Below is the original video from NSW Health.\n  Baby Bundle: Original\n     We do a quick transcription, and then investigate the returned Captions. The captions are pretty good, but its important to check the result. A good rule of thumb is to check when different people start talking, as the differences in how two individuals sound, can confuse the AI.\n  In this specific case, the AI missed the early part of what the gentleman was saying at the 00:30 second mark. The captions, after some manual editing look like below.\n    Captions after transcription      Now that we have the captions, we use the translation AI to produce a German version. Explicitly, we are using the AI to translate from English to German for the captions only, hence the audio component is not selected. Also note that we are creating a copy of the asset, and attaching the German translation to this copy of the asset.\n    Translation from English to German 1        Translation from English to German 2      We open up the new de_baby_bundle item, and now we do two things, (1) we add the caption into the audio component (copy/paste), and (2) trigger transcription again, but this time only on the second component (the audio component).\n    Copy/Paste Captions into Audio        Transcription using a German Male Voice      We now add the audio into the original asset as an overlay, and additionally mute the original audio to achieve the desired outcome. It should also be noted that we are still using captions all the way through - another alternative would be to remove the captions and put in a text overlay to allow us a finer level of control over the look/feel of the new asset.\n    Copy/Paste Captions into Audio      Please note that the German will be incorrect - its just an AI.

These are, (a) French (Canadian), (b) Portuguese (Brazilian), (c) Spanish, (d) Swedish, and (e) Turkish.\nIn total, Text-To-Speech transcription now has the below set of languages available. Please note each language has multiple dialects, and gender specific voices are available.\n           Dutch English French German Italian   Japanese Korean Portuguese Spanish Swedish   Turkish        In the below description, we show you how to use the additional languages, by overlaying audio into a video. It should be noted, transcription can be used in two ways, (a) Speech-To-Text, and (b) Text-To-Speech. This post is focused on the second option, Text-To-Speech.\nSteps   Please direct your browser to videotranslator.ai, and then click on the Login button. On successfully logging into the application, you should see an interface similar to the below. Select Template, and using the highlighted button, Edit Template: myTemplate.\n    Select the Template, and click Edit      Originally myTemplate has only one component. This is the video component.

The point is to have somewhere to use our Text-To-Speech AI.\n    Add Audio component to our Template        Template with both Video and Audio components      To recap, we edited the template to have both video and audio components. Save and Exit to the file system.\n    Save and Exit the Template      Click on our now modified myTemplate, and create a new item, big_bunny_2. The next step is to upload our old friend, the sample video.\n    Create new item Big Bunny 2        Added Big Bunny Sample Video      But what about our Audio Overlay, at this point we create it and are just going to add it in shortly. Scroll down to the Audio component, and instead of uploading a *.mp3, we instead add some text (Hello! My name is Big Bunny!) and click Add Caption. We are going to get the AI to say, \u0026lsquo;Hello! My name is Big Bunny!'\n    Added Caption: Hello! My name is Big Bunny!      Now we have some text, (a) Speech-To-Text transcribe, and (b) add an Audio Overlay. As shown below, we transcribe, but only the second component as this is where we need the voices - the plan is to use a British sounding AI voice.\n    Selected AI is the English (UK) dialect      Once complete, in the video component (a) Mute Original audio, (b) add in the Audio Overlay. Please note, we have set it to play between 2 -\u0026gt; 5 seconds, and used the +.\n    Adding the Audio Overlay      This gives us the final product. Please note (a) original audio has been muted, (b) new audio has been added, in this case the robotic voice of the AI.

Remember, each languages is potentially a new market, and care needs to be taken to properly target your preferred leads.\nThere are two kinds of transcription, the first is Speech-To-Text Transcription, the second is a Text-To-Speech Transcription. In both cases, speech is involved, hence these are referred to as transcription AI\u0026rsquo;s. Similarly, with translation, what we are actually using is a Text-To-Text Translation AI.\nYou should also know, that technically transcription is the mapping of sounds of one language into another. However, in common parlance, especially when talking in the context of using AI\u0026rsquo;s, it means using the sounds to get the AI to work out the words.\nTransliteration is a little bit different, and does not use an AI. We simply use a mapping to achieve the desired result, and as the mapping can be phonetic, it requires a human to make sure it is done correctly.\nTranscription From Wikipedia, transcription in the linguistic sense is the systematic representation of language in written form. The source can either be utterances (speech or sign language) or pre-existing text in another writing system.\nSpeech-To-Text The following languages are available within the Speech-To-Text AI. The context here is, (i) upload video, (ii) trigger transcription, (iii) select dialect as required, and the transcription AI will do the rest.\n    Select a dialect to transcribe a French video    Please remember to check the captions (play the video) and make corrections are required.

If you require a specific language, or your firm wants to plug a custom AI into our platform, please reach out. Additionally, each language can have several dialects - Spanish for example has 20 dialects - please ensure you select the appropriate dialect.  Text-To-Speech The following languages are available within the Text-To-Speech AI.

Depending on the information complexity of your content (i.e. legal, medical, or just complicated) it is highly recommended you use the AI to do the heavy lifting, and get a subject matter expert (i.e. a professional translator) to check the results.\nIn practise, it is likely to be a far more effective use of the translators time, allowing them to focus on the high value content, and be less involved in the simple translations.\n           Afrikaans Arabic Bengali Bosnian Bulgarian   Cantonese Catalan Chinese Croatian Czech   Creole Danish Dutch English Estonian   Fijian Filipino Finnish French German   Greek Creole Hebrew Hindi Hmong Daw   Hungarian Icelandic Indonesian Italian Japanese   Kiswahili Korean Latvian Malagasy Malay   Maltese Norwegian Persian Polish Portuguese   Romanian Russian Samoan Serbian Slovak   Slovenian Spanish Swedish Tahitian Tamil   Thai Tongan Turkish Urdu Ukrainian   Vietnamese Zulu       Transliteration Transliteration is a type of conversion of a text from one script to another that involves swapping letters in predictable ways.

While a challenging year, the majority of the platform was built in 2018. Oddly, doing hard things well is enormously empowering, if a little scary. Important events in 2018 included:\n Moved into Fishburners, our brilliant co-working space, in the new Sydney Start Up Hub. Brought on two fantastic developers, Vivek Kumar and Pranay Shah. Both these guys have been absolutely critical in getting our platform over the line. The original vision for the platform was to be a Content Management System (CMS) for multi-lingual websites.

Professionals execute the same tasks regularly, hence they know the in\u0026rsquo;s and the out\u0026rsquo;s of a problem and can solve it better, in a short amount of time and most often with improved costs. Knowledge, practice and experience is valued in all professions. The translation industry is not different and experienced translation professionals are most often preferred.\nUsing professional translation services should be your preferred default, especially when the content is aimed at business customers.\nMoreover, if you need certified translation for legal documents for example, marketing or technical translation for business or the translated version of documents that require high level of accuracy.\nWhy Businesses Require Professional Translations In our global world, with virtual infinite options of development, most companies no matter how small are considering expanding their operations abroad or going global. In such a context appears the necessity of surpassing language barriers and translate the necessary content and documents to reach that goal. And, of course, communicating efficiently with foreign audiences.\nThe first step is to make a company marketable on the foreign market, as basis for the primary goal of reaching as many new clients as possible. It is well known that clients in general prefer to consume information and content in their own language, thus the need of localization of content. To ensure a company reaches the desired success abroad, it needs to have its content translated in accordance with the local culture and profit on the chance to promote its products and services there.\nMost businesses do not have inhouse talents and capabilities to execute the translations at a highly professional level, so they outsource this task or partner with a supplier that can solve it.\nDepending on the complexity of the business, operations expansion might involve a professional translator, a team of professional translators or a specialised translation services agency. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of language translator versus using a specialised agency will indicate the best option upon the case.\nEven if nowadays we have tools to translate automatically the content needed, they are not able to replace a translation professional and it’s not exactly an option.\nWhy? The explanation is simple: they fail with semantic words, concepts, writing styles and mix up the meaning of the context. Automatic translation tools make often some hilarious translation errors; a business that respects itself and its image will not need such failures. For international businesses relaying on automate translation may be an expensive adventure.\nSo, using just an automatic translation is not a reliable option, not for technical, marketing or otherwise sophisticated material. Unless the respective business is ready to assume the consequences of seeing their efforts damaged by such a detail. Translation errors jeopardise intellectual property and the image of the company.\nRemember the translated copy makes or breaks the success of a company on an over sea market and impacts heavily its operations. It has direct impact on the reputation, company’s projected image across borders and brand awareness.\n    A World Of Languages    Advantages and Benefits of Translation Services for Business It results that professional translation services offer a number of benefits that cannot be neglected. You can review them below. For common small to medium translation projects, a professional translator:\n Delivers a polished and accurate copy of the original document Translates the documents correctly, efficiently, consistently and in due time. Based on their experience and qualifications, professional translators detain also target industry expertise (for example medical translation) and are able to adapt style, terminology and context. Uses professional translation tools to generate high quality translated copy Based on their translation expertise will deliver a localised copy that takes into consideration the cultural influences, inspires confidence and ensures success. Saves time and money for the client company as the quality of his/her work is high and free of errors and needs no further corrections or adjustments Will choose to translate just in the areas they have expertise in, for highly specialised areas like legal, engineering or medical. Is up to date with technological trends and modifications in cultural context and language conventions. Adheres to a strict code of ethics and handles your documents with the highest level of confidentiality and impartiality.  In the case of large and complex translation projects that involve multiple languages, multiple sites/applications, partnering with a reputed translation agency is the best solution. Because for a specialised professional translation services agency, this is their core business and what they do best. Apart of the above-mentioned benefits the translation agency will also:\n Offer access to a pool of trained and tested translators, available for an extended selection of languages, ready to start the translation work in the shortest delay. Have certified translators for the required industry and accreditation. Have in place processes to check on the quality and accuracy of the translation Spear the company that needs translation the effort of interviewing individual translators, testing them or checking their references. Have wide experience and manage complex translation projects with ease, like multiple sites and applications that a company owns, and execute them in a shorter amount of time. Act like a bridge for the client-company in relation with the target culture by making the translated content culturally and regionally appropriate, while assessing cultural differences. For example, Latin American Spanish is slightly different from European Spanish. Act like a supplementary marketing tool, as the translation agency’s experience with similar businesses help target the intended market and infuses the client’s brand with confidence. Marketing and translation combined, often lead to increased sales in the target market. Free time for the client, who will have more time at its disposal to concentrate on its core business once the translation job is outsourced to a professional translation partner.      A Translation: From One Language To Another    Professional translation services provided by a reputed translation agency are a strong strategic tool to smoothly communicate with various audiences.\nIf you were wondering about advantages and disadvantages of translation in business, well there is no doubt, translation has positive impact on business expansion, reaching higher levels of turnover and profit.\nA research made by Common Sense Advisory called \u0026ldquo;Translation at Fortune 500 Companies\u0026rdquo; emphasised that translation correlates with superior business performance. Businesses which used translation to communicate with their partners were 2.67 times more likely to obtain higher revenues. The ones that translated content to comply with local legal requirements were 1.86 times more prone to experience revenue boost and 1.33 times more likely to see improved profits.\nObviously, businesses that aim for expansion and profit growth will always look for the best professionals they can get. And professionals in translation have to answer these exigencies and be up to the required standards.\nHow Do You Qualify as Translation Professional? A professional translator has the below skills:\n  Writing skills: A translator needs to have excellent writing skills, to correctly translate the content from the primary language into content in the target language. The translator must be able to adapt their writing to different styles, such as technical, marketing, casual, formal etc. To develop a great writing ability, the translator likely has strong formal education, polished with practise and experience.\n  Advanced language skills and knowledge: It goes without saying that advanced language knowledge is needed for both the source and for the target language. Native or near-native language skills are a requirement, otherwise there is a risk of missing subtle nuances and generating errors in translation.\n  Organised and detail oriented: Some other skills are necessary to qualify as a professional in translations. Attention to detail, dedication to follow methodical processes to ensure accuracy, tenacity to find the best wording version, to name just a few, are important skills.\n  Robust translation methodology and proofreading processes: Translation is quite a complex mental process, so a clear methodology should be in place in order to avoid shortcomings. To ensure high accurate translation, a professional translator should have processes in place for, (a) specific verification, (b) editing, (c) proofreading and (d) reviewing procedures.\n  Extensive experience: As in any other industry, experience has its own role and there is no substitute. Translation skills and quality will improve over time along with gaining more and more experience.\n  These are just the main skills that someone needs to succeed in the translation world and deliver high quality translations. Hence, some other competencies are needed like cultural knowledge related to both languages included in the translation process, customer service abilities, specialised knowledge in the industries for which the translations are performed. Also, having translation certifications impacts heavily on the status of professional in this area.\nConclusion There are clear differences between a professional translator and a layman translator, and a able to speak a foreign language and it’s crucial for obtaining high quality results in translation. Translation professionals have the know-how, skills and expertise to go beyond linguistic proficiency and ensure top quality for their translation work.\nPlease connect with us on LinkedIn, YouTube or Facebook for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!\nWe are very grateful for your support!\nShould you have any questions, or just want to drop us a note saying hello, please feel free to send us an email at hello@videotranslator.ai.\n","permalink":"https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-professional-translators/","tags":["English"],"title":"What are the benefits of using Professional Translators?"},{"categories":["Video Translator","Transcription","Translation","Transliteration"],"contents":"Welcome to the Video Translator.
