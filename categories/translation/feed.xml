The gist of the news is that the Australian Prime Minister has recorded a video, which will be translated into a number of languages. Once translated, the video will be broadcast in the media in different countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iraq.</description></item><item><title>How To Use AI To Save Lions, In Afrikaans</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-to-use-ai-to-save-lions-in-afrikaans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-to-use-ai-to-save-lions-in-afrikaans/</guid><description>As part of our process for testing the platform prior to go live, one of the things we look to do is test a large number of different languages.

Professionals execute the same tasks regularly, hence they know the in&amp;rsquo;s and the out&amp;rsquo;s of a problem and can solve it better, in a short amount of time and most often with improved costs. Knowledge, practice and experience is valued in all professions. The translation industry is not different and experienced translation professionals are most often preferred.
Using professional translation services should be your preferred default, especially when the content is aimed at business customers.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to Video Translator</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/welcome-to-video-translator/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 11:16:52 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/welcome-to-video-translator/</guid><description>Welcome to the Video Translator.
