Unfortunately that did not work out.
So&amp;hellip; Happy New Year. Ok - we will do another post saying Happy New Year and listing out what we are looking forward to in 2022. But for the moment, we want to talk about 2021.
Thankfully, that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap on 2021! 2021 was a bit of a hard year for Team VideoTranslator.</description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas!</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/merry-christmas-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/merry-christmas-2021/</guid><description>Merry Christmas! And we very much hope you have had a good year, and are looking forward to winding down for year-end.
Here at VideoTranslator, we have had a mixed year, probably like most people in 2021.
We Wish You And Yours A Merry Christmas As I was writing this, the urge was to turn this into some kind of victory lap and talk about our wins and losses in 2021.</description></item><item><title>Memperkenalkan Anggota Baru: Selamat Datang Tessa, James dan Yuriy!</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/memperkenalkan-anggota-baru-tessa-james-yuriy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/memperkenalkan-anggota-baru-tessa-james-yuriy/</guid><description>Kami senang banget untuk berbagi berita ini dengan kalian!

If you need a reminder as to how to select the appropriate AI language and dialect, check out our article here.
Now, on to the voices!

This is a big deal, the only question is will this be the roaring 20&amp;rsquo;s all over again. Here at VideoTranslator we think it is going to be an exciting year.
Several amazing things happened last year, and this was mostly due to the kindness of strangers. Thank you very much to all the folks who took an interest in our work.
We started to get some traction, we found a niche where our tech was useful, and slowly slowly things started to come together.</description></item><item><title>What English Dialects are Available?</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-english-dialects-are-available/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-english-dialects-are-available/</guid><description>Did you know that our AI can speak in over 180 languages and more than 120 differing dialects and different genders? It&amp;rsquo;s true! That&amp;rsquo;s one smart robot ;)
In this article we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on English and the four different dialects that you can choose from when using our app.
For those that have you used the app before, you will notice that we have renamed the &amp;ldquo;voices&amp;rdquo;. Previously we had them named as EN-IN-P-M1, or UK-S4-M which didn&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of sense for those who were unfamiliar with the technology.</description></item><item><title>How We Used SEO To Come Up With A New Name</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-we-used-seo-to-come-up-with-a-new-name/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 23:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-we-used-seo-to-come-up-with-a-new-name/</guid><description>Our original name was QBL Media, and our new name is videotranslator.ai. The original name did not really work, and was always a temporary name.
This post covers some of the context of where our platform came from, and what changes happened in the course of getting this app to market, including a pivot.
We used SEO to determine a new name. Read on to understand why this was done, how it was done, and what benefits we expect to get from the name change.</description></item><item><title>We Just Launched And We Need Luck</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/we-just-launched-and-we-need-luck/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/we-just-launched-and-we-need-luck/</guid><description>For the last 2 years or so, we have been working on a new platform which we think will be super useful for content creators. This includes marketers for exporters, tourism concerns, media shops and everyday folks looking to build brands and businesses using tools like YouTube and LinkedIn.
Just for some background, we are a tiny software company, and think of ourselves as basically an independent studio, trying to craft the best tools we can.</description></item><item><title>What Languages Are Available?</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-languages-are-available/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-languages-are-available/</guid><description>We look at the number of languages which you can use with your content. Remember, each languages is potentially a new market, and care needs to be taken to properly target your preferred leads.
There are two kinds of transcription, the first is Speech-To-Text Transcription, the second is a Text-To-Speech Transcription. In both cases, speech is involved, hence these are referred to as transcription AI&amp;rsquo;s. Similarly, with translation, what we are actually using is a Text-To-Text Translation AI.</description></item><item><title>Happy New Year!</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/happy-new-year/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/happy-new-year/</guid><description>We had a very good 2018 here at Video Translator. While a challenging year, the majority of the platform was built in 2018. Oddly, doing hard things well is enormously empowering, if a little scary. Important events in 2018 included:
Moved into Fishburners, our brilliant co-working space, in the new Sydney Start Up Hub. Brought on two fantastic developers, Vivek Kumar and Pranay Shah. Both these guys have been absolutely critical in getting our platform over the line.</description></item><item><title>Visual Guides: How To Sign-Up</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/tutorial-how-to-sign-up/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 00:00:05 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/tutorial-how-to-sign-up/</guid><description>The below describes how to sign-up to the Video Translator application.
