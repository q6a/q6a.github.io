Unfortunately that did not work out.
So&amp;hellip; Happy New Year. Ok - we will do another post saying Happy New Year and listing out what we are looking forward to in 2022. But for the moment, we want to talk about 2021.
Thankfully, that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap on 2021! 2021 was a bit of a hard year for Team VideoTranslator.</description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas!</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/merry-christmas-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/merry-christmas-2021/</guid><description>Merry Christmas!

Many people choose to pass on their homes, investments and possessions.
For Jeff Dormish, leaving a legacy means so much more than that. He does not just want to leave possessions; he wants to pass on his history.
For many Americans, most of their ancestors came from Europe in the great emigration wave before the First World War. Jeff Dormish’s ancestors also came from Europe, Slovenia, to be exact.</description></item><item><title>What Is Next For VideoTranslator?</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-is-next-for-video-translator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/what-is-next-for-video-translator/</guid><description>What Comes Next Things never go right in a startup.
Honestly. Even when they go right, generally something odd happens and it all works out for the best, but things tend to not go to plan, so to speak.
Firstly, for those of you who have recently joined our little community, welcome!
We are very glad to have you here, and hopefully the work of Team VideoTranslator and our community of friends, well wishers, prospects, and clients will help you achieve your goals.</description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas 2020!

But we are not transcribers, translators, or voice over artists. We use AI to do transcription, translation and synthetic (AI) dubbing.
This happens when a client is looking to try out tech and/or better understand the value proposition, or has their own reasons for us to provide this service.
Sometimes however, the most useful thing we can do is just have a conversation.</description></item><item><title>Patch Notes: January 2020</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/patch-notes-january-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/patch-notes-january-2020/</guid><description>There are a number of bug fixes and patches, which may affect your experience.
