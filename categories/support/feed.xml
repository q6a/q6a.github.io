Honestly. Even when the go right, generally something odd happens and it all works out for the best, but things tend to not go plan, so to speak.
Firstly, for those of you who have recently joined our little community, welcome!
We are very glad to have you here, and hopefully the work of Team VideoTranslator and our community of friends, well wishers, prospects, and clients will help you achieve your goals.</description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas 2020!

But we are not transcribers, translators, or voice over artists. We use AI to do transcription, translation and synthetic (AI) dubbing.
This happens when a client is looking to try out tech and/or better understand the value proposition, or has their own reasons for us to provide this service.
Sometimes however, the most useful thing we can do is just have a conversation.</description></item><item><title>Patch Notes: January 2020</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/patch-notes-january-2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/patch-notes-january-2020/</guid><description>There are a number of bug fixes and patches, which may affect your experience.
