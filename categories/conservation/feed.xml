Recently, his work has included a kickstarter to create art work in traditional Nepalese script known as Ranjana.
We look at a language he shone some light on today. We also look at work Comcast is doing to support hearing impaired clients. This is quite exciting from an operational perspective.
Lastly we look at a recent write up from the Latin Post which looks at how to interface with commercial translation firms for your localisation and internationalization requirements.</description></item><item><title>How To Use AI To Save Lions, In Afrikaans</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-to-use-ai-to-save-lions-in-afrikaans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/how-to-use-ai-to-save-lions-in-afrikaans/</guid><description>As part of our process for testing the platform prior to go live, one of the things we look to do is test a large number of different languages. Part of it is good fun, the other objective is to try to change things around to see if we can break the platform and find bugs.
Realistically, this means looking for cool videos, and then trying things out with the videos.</description></item></channel></rss>
