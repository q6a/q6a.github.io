Professionals execute the same tasks regularly, hence they know the in&rsquo;s and the out&rsquo;s of a problem and can solve it better, in a short amount of time and most often with improved costs. Knowledge, practice and experience are valued in all professions. The translation industry is not different and experienced translation professionals are most often preferred.</p><p><em>Using professional translation services should be your preferred default, especially when the content is aimed at business customers.</em></p><p>Moreover, if you need certified translation for legal documents, for example, marketing or technical translation for business or the translated version of documents that require a high level of accuracy.</p><a class=headline-hash href=#why-businesses-require-professional-translations><h2 id=why-businesses-require-professional-translations>Why Businesses Require Professional Translations</a></h2><p>In our global world, with virtual infinite options of development, most companies no matter how small are considering expanding their operations abroad or going global. In such a context appears the necessity of surpassing language barriers and translate the necessary content and documents to reach that goal. And, of course, communicating efficiently with foreign audiences.</p><p>The first step is to make a company marketable on the foreign market, as the basis for the primary goal of reaching as many new clients as possible. It is well known that clients, in general, prefer to consume information and content in their own language, thus the need for localization of content. To ensure a company reaches the desired success abroad, it needs to have its content translated in accordance with the local culture and profit on the chance to promote its products and services there.</p><p><em>Most businesses do not have in-house talents and capabilities to execute the translations at a highly professional level, so they outsource this task or partner with a supplier that can solve it.</em></p><p>Depending on the complexity of the business, operations expansion might involve a professional translator, a team of professional translators or a specialised translation services agency. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of a language translator versus using a specialised agency will indicate the best option in the case.</p><p>Even if nowadays we have tools to translate automatically the content needed, they are not able to replace a translator professional and it’s not exactly an option.</p><p>Why? The explanation is simple: they fail with semantic words, concepts, writing styles and mix up the meaning of the context. Automatic translation tools make often some hilarious translation errors; a business that respects itself and its image will not need such failures. For international businesses relaying on automated translation may be an expensive adventure.</p><p>So, using just an automatic translation is not a reliable option, not for technical, marketing or otherwise sophisticated material. Unless the respective business is ready to assume the consequences of seeing their efforts damaged by such a detail. Translation errors jeopardise intellectual property and the image of the company.</p><p><em>Remember the translated copy makes or breaks the success of a company on an overseas market and impacts heavily its operations. It has a direct impact on the reputation, company’s projected image across borders and brand awareness.</em></p><a class=headline-hash href=#advantages-and-benefits-of-translation-services-for-business><h2 id=advantages-and-benefits-of-translation-services-for-business>Advantages and Benefits of Translation Services for Business</a></h2><p>It results that professional translation services offer a number of benefits that cannot be neglected. You can review them below. For common small to medium translation projects, a professional translator:</p><ul><li>Delivers a polished and accurate copy of the original document</li><li>Translates the documents correctly, efficiently, consistently and in due time. Based on their experience and qualifications, professional translators detain also target industry expertise (for example medical translation) and are able to adapt style, terminology and context.</li><li>Uses professional translation tools to generate high quality translated copy</li><li>Based on their translation expertise will deliver a localised copy that takes into consideration the cultural influences, inspires confidence and ensures success.</li><li>Saves time and money for the client company as the quality of his/her work is high and free of errors and needs no further corrections or adjustments</li><li>Will choose to translate just in the areas they have expertise in, for highly specialised areas like legal, engineering or medical.</li><li>Is up to date with technological trends and modifications in cultural context and language conventions.</li><li>Adheres to a strict code of ethics and handles your documents with the highest level of confidentiality and impartiality.</li></ul><p>In the case of large and complex translation projects that involve multiple languages, multiple sites/applications, partnering with a reputed translation agency is the best solution. Because for a <em>specialised professional translation services agency, this is their core business and what they do best</em>. Apart of the above-mentioned benefits the translation agency will also:</p><ul><li>Offer access to a pool of trained and tested translators, available for an extended selection of languages, ready to start the translation work in the shortest delay.</li><li>Have certified translators for the required industry and accreditation.</li><li>Have in place processes to check on the quality and accuracy of the translation</li><li>Spear the company that needs translation the effort of interviewing individual translators, testing them or checking their references.</li><li>Have wide experience and manage complex translation projects with ease, like multiple sites and applications that a company owns, and execute them in a shorter amount of time.</li><li>Act as a bridge for the client-company in relation to the target culture by making the translated content culturally and regionally appropriate, while assessing cultural differences. For example, Latin American Spanish is slightly different from European Spanish.</li><li>Act like a supplementary marketing tool, as the translation agency’s experience with similar businesses help target the intended market and infuses the client’s brand with confidence. Marketing and translation combined, often lead to increased sales in the target market.</li><li>Free time for the client, who will have more time at its disposal to concentrate on its core business once the translation job is outsourced to a professional translation partner.</li></ul><center><figure class=img-bod><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-src=https://storage.googleapis.com/site-assets-prod/blog_assets/conversation-1092128_960_720.jpg alt="A Translation: From One Language To Another" layout=responsive class="img-responsive lazyload" loading=lazy></span><figcaption>A Translation: From One Language To Another</figcaption></figure></center><p><em>Professional translation services provided by a reputed translation agency are a strong strategic tool to smoothly communicate with various audiences</em>.</p><p>If you were wondering about the advantages and disadvantages of translation in business, well there is no doubt, translation has positive impact on business expansion, reaching higher levels of turnover and profit.</p><p>A research made by <a href=http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/>Common Sense Advisory</a> called &ldquo;Translation at Fortune 500 Companies&rdquo; emphasised that translation correlates with superior business performance. Businesses which used translation to communicate with their partners were 2.67 times more likely to obtain higher revenues. The ones that translated content to comply with local legal requirements were 1.86 times more prone to experience revenue boost and 1.33 times more likely to see improved profits.</p><p>Obviously, businesses that aim for expansion and profit growth will always look for the best professionals they can get. And professionals in translation have to answer these exigencies and be up to the required standards.</p><a class=headline-hash href=#how-do-you-qualify-as-translation-professionalhttpswwwdaytranslationscomblogskills-for-translators><h2 id=how-do-you-qualify-as-translation-professionalhttpswwwdaytranslationscomblogskills-for-translators>How Do You Qualify as <a href=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/skills-for-translators/>Translation Professional</a>?</a></h2><p>A professional translator has the below skills:</p><ul><li>Writing skills: A translator needs to have excellent writing skills, to correctly translate the content from the primary language into content in the target language. The translator must be able to adapt their writing to different styles, such as technical, marketing, casual, formal etc. To develop great writing ability, the translator likely has strong formal education, polished with practice and experience.</li><li>Advanced language skills and knowledge: It goes without saying that advanced language knowledge is needed for both the source and for the target language. Native or near-native language skills are a requirement, otherwise, there is a risk of missing subtle nuances and generating errors in translation.</li><li>Organised and detail-oriented: Some other skills are necessary to qualify as a professional in translations. Attention to detail, dedication to follow methodical processes to ensure accuracy, tenacity to find the best wording version, to name just a few, are important skills.</li><li>Robust translation methodology and proofreading processes: Translation is quite a complex mental process, so a clear methodology should be in place in order to avoid shortcomings. To ensure high accurate translation, a professional translator should have processes in place for, (a) specific verification, (b) editing, (c) proofreading and (d) reviewing procedures.</li><li>Extensive experience: As in any other industry, experience has its own role and there is no substitute. Translation skills and quality will improve over time along with gaining more and more experience.</li></ul><p>These are just the main skills that someone needs to succeed in the translation world and deliver high-quality translations. Hence, some other competencies are needed like cultural knowledge related to both languages included in the translation process, customer service abilities, specialised knowledge in the industries for which the translations are performed. Also, having translation certifications impacts heavily on the status of professionals in this area.</p><a class=headline-hash href=#conclusion><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</a></h2><p>There are clear differences between a professional translator and a layman translator, and an ability to speak a foreign language and it’s crucial for obtaining high-quality results in translation. Translation professionals have the know-how, skills and expertise to go beyond linguistic proficiency and ensure top quality for their translation work.</p><p>Please connect with us on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/videotranslator/>LinkedIn</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGrwmRcZiFkyq8-xAwn77Yg/>YouTube</a> or <a href=https://www.facebook.com/videotranslatorai/>Facebook</a> for any comments, questions, or just to keep up to date with the work we do!</p><p><code>We are very grateful for your support!</code></p><p>Should you have any questions, or just want to drop us a note saying hello, please feel free to send us an email at <a href=mailto:hello@videotranslator.ai>hello@videotranslator.ai</a>.</p></div><div class=section-footer><div class=section-sharing><div class=section-socials><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fvideotranslator.ai%2fnews%2fwhat-are-the-benefits-of-using-professional-translators%2f&title=What%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20using%20Professional%20Translators%3f" title="Share What are the benefits of using Professional Translators? on LinkedIn" aria-label="Share What are the benefits of using Professional Translators? on LinkedIn" target=_blank class=sharing-icon><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" alt="Share What are the benefits of using Professional Translators? on Linkedin"></i></a>
