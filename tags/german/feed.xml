Germany is still a country divided when it comes to what a pancake should be called - maybe they should be called egg-cakes? Also Mandarin is now Melbourne and Sydney&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;most widely spoken community language.&amp;rdquo;
Language matters, it&amp;rsquo;s important culturally and on a deeper level to help us identify with ourselves and others.</description></item><item><title>Samples From A Voice Over Robot: French, German and Dutch</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/samples-from-a-voice-over-robot-french-german-and-dutch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/samples-from-a-voice-over-robot-french-german-and-dutch/</guid><description>Following on from last week&amp;rsquo;s blog post, where we looked at different English dialects, we are going to do much the same today in Dutch, French and German.

What we are going to do today is transcribe content to a different language, and use a practical example to demonstrate the technology.
We will be using this video, from the team at NSWHealth. The video is a simple, but effective solution for young mothers, where NSWHealth provide a useful box of household items aimed at first time mothers.</description></item><item><title>Visual Guides: How To Translate A Video without Sound</title><link>https://videotranslator.ai/news/tutorial-how-to-translate-a-video-without-sound/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://videotranslator.ai/news/tutorial-how-to-translate-a-video-without-sound/</guid><description>We look at how to translate video content. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text1. In brief, we will (i) upload a video, (ii) add text, (iii) translate the video text, (iv) download a translated video.
Steps We need a sample video to work with, and will use the Big Bunny video from Sample Video&amp;rsquo;s.
